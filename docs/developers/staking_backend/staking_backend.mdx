# Bitcoin Staking Backend System

The Bitcoin Staking Backend is a robust system designed to facilitate Bitcoin
staking operations on the Babylon network. It comprises specialized services that
extract, validate, and transform blockchain data from both the Bitcoin and
Babylon chains. These services provide performant, API-friendly interfaces for
decentralized applications (dApps), manage staking lifecycle states, and ensure
secure and efficient handling of staking transactions such as withdrawal
processes.

## Deployment Overview

This guide outlines the deployment process for the Phase-2 Bitcoin Staking
Backend system. Follow the steps in sequence for successful installation or
upgrade from the corresponding Phase-1 system.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the staking services, ensure the following components are
properly set up:

- **Bitcoin Full Node** - [Setup Guide](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)  
  _Powers transaction verification on the Bitcoin network_

- **Babylon Node** - [Setup Guide](/operators/babylon_node/installation_guide/)  
  _Connects to the Babylon blockchain for monitoring staking events_

- **MongoDB Clusters** - [Setup Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)  
  _Stores all staking data and transaction history_

- **RabbitMQ** - [Setup Guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)  
  _Handles message queuing between system components_

- **Global Configuration** - [Setup Guide](./services/global_config)  
  _Defines system-wide parameters for all services_

{/* Database Migration (Optional) - Clone Phase-1 database snapshot, apply snapshot to new MongoDB clusters.
Required only if supporting Phase-1 registration data */}

## Migrating from phase-1 stack

The migration from phase-1 to phase-2 involves several critical steps to ensure
a smooth transition while maintaining service availability. Here's the detailed
migration process:

1. **Shut down phase-1 services**:
   - Stop the phase-1 indexer service with `systemctl stop $SERVICE_NAME`. This 
     allows the service to finish current tasks and shut down gracefully.

2. **Database preparation** (Optional):
   - Create a complete backup of your MongoDB databases
   - Verify backup integrity before proceeding

3. **Deploy phase-2 services**:
   - Continue with the steps outlined in the "Launching Services" section below
   - The phase-2 API service is fully backward compatible, ensuring users won't
     notice any service disruption

**Important notes**:
- The phase-2 indexer can be deployed earlier (even while legacy services are
  running) to give it time to synchronize with the Babylon network


### Launching Services

Once all prerequisites are checked off, deploy these services in the following
order:

#### 1. Deploy Staking Indexer
- [Staking Indexer Setup Guide](./services/staking_indexer)
- _This service monitors both blockchains and processes all staking events_

#### 2. Deploy Staking Expiry Checker
- [Staking Expiry Checker Setup Guide](./services/staking_expiry_checker)
- _Manages expired delegations and state transitions_

#### 3. Deploy Staking API Service
- [Staking API Service Setup Guide](./services/staking_api_service)
- _Provides the API endpoints for all staking operations_
- âœ“ Test the API endpoints after deployment

### Verification

After completing all steps, verify your deployment by:
1. Checking service logs for any errors
2. Using the `/healthcheck` endpoint to verify API service health
