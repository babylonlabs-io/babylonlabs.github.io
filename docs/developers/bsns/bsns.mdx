# Building Bitcoin Secured Networks

Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSNs) are a type of blockchain that uses Bitcoin as the 
underlying security layer or additional security layer.


## Cosmos Chains

Cosmos chains can integrate with Babylon to get security from BTC stake. This is made more 
important for new Cosmos chains with less staking TVL. In addition, the staked BTC 
achieves *slashable safety*, a strong security property that the equivocations by 
BTC-backed Finality Providers are held accountable, even 
when equivocating Finality Providers constitute a majority.

## OP-stack Chains

OP-stack chains can integrate with the Babylon BTC staking protocol to get Bitcoin 
security. 

This has a few benefits: 

- **Better economic security:** There is native BTC staked to protect the rollup and 
improve its economic security. This is made more important for new OP-stack chains with 
fewer adoption. In addition, the staked BTC achieves *slashable safety*, a strong 
security property that equivocations by L2 sequencers are held accountable and the BTC 
stake is slashable, even when equivocating L2 sequencers constitute a majority.
- **Fast finality:** The improved economic security will benefit the OP stack chains for 
fast finality. If the user is willing to trust the votes backed by the BTC stake, then 
the user can confirm transactions and make decisions without waiting for the lengthy 
challenging period in optimistic rollups.
- **Reorg resilience of L2 transactions:** Once a transaction is included in an L2 block 
signed by the majority of BTC-backed Finality Providers, the sequencer cannot publish a 
different L2 block at the same height on L1.
