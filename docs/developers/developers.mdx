# Babylon Developers

Babylon isn't just another BTC staking project - it's a platform for innovative 
developers to leverage the most secure blockchain in the world: Bitcoin, and create
something unique to the web3 market. Whether you're a blockchain architect, dapp 
developer, DeFi founder, infrastructure builder, or protocol designer, Babylon 
offers unique opportunities in the shared-security space.

### Pathways

#### 1. Bitcoin Secured Network Development
**Build Next-Generation Proof-of-Stake Chains**
- Create or integrate existing PoS networks with unprecedented security guarantees
- Leverage Bitcoin's economic security without bridging or wrapping assets
- Implement fast-finality chains with robust economic protection

**Key Technologies:**
- CosmWasm smart contract integration
- IBC-enabled communication
- Native Bitcoin staking protocols

#### 2. Smart Contract Development
**Utilize the extremely programmable Babylon Genesis**
- Deploy CosmWasm smart contracts
- Create decentralized applications with Bitcoin-backed security
- Develop novel DeFi primitives with staked BTC or staked BABY tokens 

**Development Environment:**
- Rust-based smart contract development (CosmWasm)
- Partner oracles that work with Babylon Genesis

#### 3. Infrastructure and Tooling
**Develop Critical Network Components**
- Build monitoring and validation tools (e.g. via Vigilantes)
- Develop new tools via Bitcoin timestamping services (e.g. fast finality)
- Design Finality Provider management systems 
- Create new explorer tools to show insights of Babylon network

**Example Projects:**
- Finality Provider and explorer tools
- Staking Delegation management interfaces
- Network health monitoring tools
- Staking and delegation strategy tools
