# Babylon Developers

Babylon isn't just another BTC staking project - it's a platform for innovative
developers to leverage the most secure blockchain in the world: Bitcoin, and create
something unique to the web3 market. Whether you're a blockchain architect, dapp
developer, DeFi founder, infrastructure builder, or protocol designer, Babylon
offers unique opportunities in the Bitcoin staking space.

### Pathways

#### 1. Bitcoin Staking Integration
**Build on Bitcoin's Economic Security**
- Integrate with Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol
- Leverage Bitcoin's economic security without bridging or wrapping assets
- Implement applications with robust economic protection

**Key Technologies:**
- CosmWasm smart contract integration
- IBC-enabled communication
- Native Bitcoin staking protocols

Read more on [Bitcoin Staking](/guides/overview/bitcoin_staking/).

#### 2. Smart Contract Development
**Utilize the extremely programmable Babylon Genesis**
- Deploy CosmWasm smart contracts
- Create decentralized applications with Bitcoin-backed security
- Develop novel DeFi primitives with staked BTC or staked BABY tokens

**Development Environment:**
- Rust-based smart contract development (CosmWasm)
- Partner oracles that work with Babylon Genesis

Read more on [dApp deployments](/developers/babylon_genesis_chain/dapps/smart_contract_deployment).

#### 3. Infrastructure and Tooling
**Develop Critical Network Components**
- Build monitoring and validation tools (e.g. via Vigilantes)
- Develop new tools via Bitcoin timestamping services (e.g. fast finality)
- Design Finality Provider management systems
- Create new explorer tools to show insights of Babylon network

**Example Projects:**
- Finality Provider and explorer tools
- Staking Delegation management interfaces
- Network health monitoring tools
- Staking and delegation strategy tools
