dApps deployed on Babbylon Genesis automatically inherit unprecedented security guarantee 
from staked BTCs. 

Babbylon Genesis is built on Cosmos SDK and uses the CometBFT consensus engine. The 
implementation of CosmWasm Virtual machine allows developers to gain sophisticated 
programming capabilities of the staked security or on-chain information. This is able 
to sustain complex decentralized applications.

Applications developed on Babbylon Genesis can gain access to an unique market position 
as it intersects Bitcoin's significant liquidity pool and utilized Bitcoin's already 
established network effects.
