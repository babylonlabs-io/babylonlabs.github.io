# Bitcoin Supercharged dApps

dApps deployed on Babylon Genesis automatically inherit unprecedented security guarantees 
from staked BTCs. 

Babylon Genesis is built on Cosmos SDK and uses the CometBFT consensus engine. The 
implementation of the CosmWasm Virtual Machine allows developers to gain sophisticated 
programming capabilities of the staked security or on-chain information. This is able 
to sustain complex decentralized applications.

Applications developed on Babylon Genesis can gain access to a unique market position 
as it intersects Bitcoin's significant liquidity pool and utilizes Bitcoin's already 
established network effects.
