# Wallet Integration Recommendation  

To provide the best experience for users here are some suggestions to wallet  
developers:  

1.  **Epochised Staking UI**:  
    
    *   Show a clear indication that staking operations are queued for  
        end-of-epoch execution  
        
    *   Display estimated time until the end of current epoch  
        
    *   Provide a way to view all pending staking operations  
        
2.  **Fast Unbonding UI**:  
    
    *   Accurately communicate the unbonding period  
        
    *   Indicate that unbonding leverages Bitcoin security  
        
    *   If possible, show progress of Bitcoin confirmations for unbonding  
        requests  
        
3.  **Slashing Warnings**:  
    
    *   Include clear warnings about the slashing risk  
        
    *   Highlight the importance of choosing reliable validators  
        

## Implementation Best Practices  

1.  **Proper Error Handling**:  
    
    *   Handle epoch transition edge cases  
        
    *   Manage potential failures due to users spending funds before epoch  
        processing  
        
2.  **Refresh Strategies**:  
    
    *   Implement proper cache refreshing after expected epoch boundaries  
        
    *   Update delegation status after expected unbonding completion times  
        
3.  **Testing**:  
    
    *   Test thoroughly against Babylon testnet before mainnet integration  
        
    *   Verify all epoch-based operations complete as expected  
        
4.  **User Communication**:  
    
    *   Clearly explain the unique aspects of BABY staking (epochised staking,  
        fast unbonding)  
        
    *   Provide educational content about the relationship between Bitcoin  
        security and BABY staking  
        

## Common Integration Challenges  

1.  **Epochised Staking Transition**:  
    
    *   Users transferring funds after staking transaction but before epoch  
        processing  
        
    *   Solution: Clear warnings about not transferring funds until end of epoch  
        
2.  **Fast Unbonding Expectations**:  
    
    *   Managing user expectations around unbonding times, which depend on  
        Bitcoin block times  
        
    *   Solution: Provide estimated time ranges rather than exact times  
        
3.  **Validator Selection**:  
    
    *   Helping users choose reliable validators to minimize slashing risk  
        
    *   Solution: Display validator uptime, commission rates, and voting power
