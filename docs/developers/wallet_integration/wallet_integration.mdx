# Wallet Integration Guide

This document is designed for wallet providers
aiming to integrate with the Babylon Genesis chain.

Babylon Genesis chain is built using the Cosmos SDK and secured by Bitcoin via
Babylon Bitcoin Staking Protocol. This dual-security mechanism allows Bitcoin 
holders and BABY token holders to participate in securing the network while
maintaining the ability to stake, unbond, and withdraw their assets quickly.

As a wallet provider, you will need to support both Babylon Genesis chain
transactions and Bitcoin Staking transactions to participate fully:


1. **Native wallet support of the Babylon Genesis chain**:
   Enable native support for the Babylon Genesis chain, including
   functionality for managing token balances, executing transfers,
   and facilitating staking operations.

   * For detailed integration instructions, 
     refer to the [Babylon Wallet Integration guide](./babylon_wallet_integration/babylon_wallet_integration/)

2. **Support of Bitcoin staking**: Participate in Bitcoin staking
   by integrating with a web application or by natively integrating
   Bitcoin staking functionality directly to your wallet,
   whether it's a browser extension, mobile app, or hardware wallet.

   * For detailed instructions,
     refer to the [Bitcoin Staking Integration guide](./bitcoin_wallet_integration/bitcoin_staking_integration/)


:::note
In Phase 2, the bitcoin staker's BTC stake can be used to stake on Babylon 
Genesis Finality Providers while BABY staker can stake on Babylon Genesis 
CometBFT Validators.
