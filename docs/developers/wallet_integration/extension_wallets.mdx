# Extension Wallets

**Option-1**, be added to a third partyâ€™s Bitcoin Staking website as
a wallet for either Bitcoin or Babylon or both.
This requires collaboration with the host of the
website and exposing compatible wallet APIs.
- To be supported in the Babylon hosted staking website as a Bitcoin or Babylon
wallet, please integrate with the Tomo Wallet Connect
by following the [docs](https://docs.tomo.inc/tomo-sdk/tomo-connect-sdk-lite).
  - This is the preferred method for wallet integration that will achieve
the most timely results. The Babylon hosted website will also support
native wallet integrations for select wallets with long-established
support.

**Option-2**, host your own Bitcoin Staking website
that connects to your extension wallet and retrieves
staking information from a back-end you operate.
- For information about developing/hosting your own Bitcoin staking website, please check
  - our reference web application
[implementation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/simple-staking/).
  - our
[TypeScript](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/btc-staking-ts/)
and [Golang](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/btcstaking/)
Bitcoin Staking libraries for creating Bitcoin Staking transactions.
<!-- TODO: the reference staking library should support the Babylon parts of staking -->
  - our [documentation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/x/btcstaking)
on the flow of Bitcoin Staking transaction creation and submission in
conjunction with Bitcoin and Babylon blockchains.

**Option-3**, develop Bitcoin Staking as a feature of your extension wallet,
which connects to either third party APIs
(such as the Babylon [API](https://staking-api.babylonlabs.io/swagger/index.html)) or a back-end you operate.
- For information about developing your own Bitcoin Staking as a feature, please check
