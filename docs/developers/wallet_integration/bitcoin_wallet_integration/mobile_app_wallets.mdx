# Bitcoin Staking for Mobile App Wallets

This guide outlines the various options for integrating Babylon bitcoin staking 
functionality into mobile app wallets. 

## Option 1

Embed a third-party Bitcoin staking website to your mobile app
wallet, which interacts with the Bitcoin and Babylon signers inside your wallet via
the application window interface.
To embed on the Babylon hosted staking website, please ensure
that the interface of your mobile wallet (or a wrapper of it)
adheres to the
[Injectable Wallet interface](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/wallet-connector?tab=readme-ov-file#wallet-integration).


## Option 2

Host your own bitcoin staking website that connects to your
extension wallet that retrieves staking information from a backend you
operate. Then embed your own Bitcoin staking website to your mobile app wallet.
* For information about developing/hosting your own Bitcoin staking website,
  please check:
    * our reference web application
      [implementation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/simple-staking/).
    * our
      [TypeScript](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/btc-staking-ts/)
      and [Golang](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/btcstaking/)
      Bitcoin Staking libraries for creating bitcoin Staking transactions.
    * our [documentation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/x/btcstaking)
      on the flow of bitcoin Staking transaction creation and submission in
      conjunction with Bitcoin and Babylon blockchains.
* For information about the reference Babylon staking backend, please read this
  [document](/guides/networks/phase-2/testnet/staking_backend/).

## Option 3

Develop bitcoin staking as a feature of your mobile wallet,
  which connects to either third party APIs
  (such as the Babylon
  [Staking API](/api/staking-api/babylon-staking-api/)) or a backend you operate.

* For information about developing your own bitcoin staking as a feature,
  please check:
