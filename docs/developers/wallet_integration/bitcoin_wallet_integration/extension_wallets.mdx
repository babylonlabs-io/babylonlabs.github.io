# Bitcoin Staking for Extension Wallets

This guide outlines the various approaches for integrating Babylon bitcoin staking 
functionality into browser extension wallets. 

## Option 1

Be added to a third partyâ€™s bitcoin staking website as
a wallet for either Bitcoin or Babylon or both.
This requires collaboration with the host of the
website and exposing compatible wallet APIs.
* To be supported in the Babylon hosted staking website as a Bitcoin or Babylon
  wallet, please integrate with the Tomo Wallet Connect
  by following the
  [docs](https://docs.tomo.inc/tomo-sdk/tomo-connect-sdk-lite).
    * This is the preferred method for wallet integration that will achieve
      the most timely results. The Babylon hosted website will also support
      native wallet integrations for select wallets with long-established
      support.

## Option 2

Host your own bitcoin staking website
that connects to your extension wallet and retrieves
staking information from a backend you operate.
* For information about `developing/hosting` your own bitcoin staking website,
  please check:
    * our reference web application
      [implementation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/simple-staking/).
    * our
      [TypeScript](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/btc-staking-ts/)
      and [Golang](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/btcstaking/)
      Bitcoin Staking libraries for creating bitcoin Staking transactions.
    * our [documentation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/x/btcstaking)
      on the flow of bitcoin staking transaction creation and submission in
      conjunction with Bitcoin and Babylon Genesis blockchains.
* For information about the reference Babylon staking backend, please read this
  [document](/guides/networks/phase-2/testnet/staking_backend/).

## Option 3

Develop bitcoin staking as a feature on your extension wallet,
which connects to either third party APIs
(such as the Babylon [Staking API](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/api/staking-api/babylon-staking-api/)) or a backend you operate.

* For information about developing your own bitcoin staking as a feature,
  please check:
    * our reference web application [implementation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/simple-staking/tree/main).
    * our
    [TypeScript](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/btc-staking-ts/)
    and [Golang](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/btcstaking/)
    Bitcoin Staking libraries.

    conjunction with Bitcoin and Babylon Genesis blockchains.
