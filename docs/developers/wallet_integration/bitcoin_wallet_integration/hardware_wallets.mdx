# Hardware Wallets

This guide outlines the various approaches for integrating Babylon bitcoin staking 
functionality into hardwarewallets. 

## Option 1

Develop bitcoin staking as a feature of your hardware wallet,
which connects to either third party APIs
(such as the Babylon [Staking API](https://staking-api.babylonlabs.io/swagger/doc.json)) or a backend you operate.

* For information about developing your own Bitcoin staking as a feature,
  please check:
    * our reference web application [implementation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/simple-staking/tree/main).
    * our
      [TypeScript](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/btc-staking-ts/)
      and [Golang](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/btcstaking/)
      Bitcoin Staking libraries.
    * our [documentation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/x/btcstaking)
      on the flow of bitcoin staking transaction creation and submission in
      conjunction with Bitcoin and Babylon Genesis blockchains.

* For information about the reference Babylon staking backend, please read this
  [document](/guides/networks/phase-2/testnet/staking_backend/).

## Option 2

Integrate via a compatible software wallet (extension or mobile)
that is bitcoin staking enabled.
