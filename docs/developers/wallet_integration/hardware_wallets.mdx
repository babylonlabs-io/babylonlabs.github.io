# Hardware Wallets

**Option-1**, develop Bitcoin Staking as a feature of your hardware wallet,
which connects to either third party APIs
(such as the Babylon [API](https://staking-api.babylonlabs.io/swagger/index.html)) or a back-end you operate.
- For information about developing your own Bitcoin Staking as a feature, please check
    - our reference web application [implementation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/simple-staking/tree/main).
    - our
      [TypeScript](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/btc-staking-ts/)
      and [Golang](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/btcstaking/)
      Bitcoin Staking libraries.
    - our [documentation](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/tree/main/x/btcstaking)
      on the flow of Bitcoin Staking transaction creation and submission in
      conjunction with Bitcoin and Babylon blockchains.

**Option-2**, integrate via a compatible software wallet (extension or mobile)
that enables Bitcoin Staking.
