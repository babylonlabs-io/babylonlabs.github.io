# Bitcoin Mainnet

Bitcoin mainnet is the live production network of Bitcoin, the primary blockchain network where real Bitcoin (BTC) transactions occur with actual economic value. This is the actual Bitcoin blockchain handling billions of dollars in value, where all transactions are permanently recorded and secured by Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism through thousands of nodes worldwide. The network provides complete Bitcoin scripting capabilities for advanced contracts and immutable transaction recording.

Babylon enables Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet using self-custodial staking contracts, allowing users to maintain full control over their Bitcoin while participating in staking activities.
