# Proposal Review Guide  

Each vote is an opportunity to influence Babylon Genesis' direction, making careful review not just nice, but essential. This guide helps you evaluate proposals systematically, ensuring your voting decisions are well-informed and contribute meaningfully to the network's future.  

## Understand the Context  

Start by identifying key information about the proposal:  

### Proposal Details

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Type** | Determine if this proposal is a Text, Parameter Change, Smart Contract Deployment, Software Upgrade, or Custom Proposal |
| **Proposer** | Check details regarding the identity of the proposer, including their background, history, and reputation within the community |
| **Timeline** | Check for important dates, such as the Submission Date, Voting End Date, and the Implementation Schedule |
| **Deposit** | Check the status (Has the minimum of 50,000 BABY been reached?), list the contributors, and state the current amount |

## General Checklist for Proposal Analysis  

Utilize this checklist when reviewing proposals:  

- Carefully reviewed the entire proposal, including all linked documentation.  
- Understand the changes that this proposal aims to implement.  
- Examined community discussions to this proposal.  
- Weighed both the benefits and potential risks associated with it.  
- Recognized how this proposal may affect various stakeholders.  
- Confirmed that the proposer has addressed community feedback.  
- Considered the long-term implications beyond the immediate effects.  
- Evaluated the proposal's alignment with Babylon's core values.  
- If this is a technical proposal, grasp the implementation strategy.  

## Analysis Based on Type  

### For Text Proposals:  

- Is the proposal clearly articulated and well-structured?  
- Are the objectives and expected outcomes explicitly defined?  
- Does it incorporate data, research, or evidence to substantiate its claims?  
- Are potential risks, drawbacks, or trade-offs acknowledged?  

### For Parameter Change Proposals:  

- What specific parameters are being modified?  
- What are the current values and the proposed new values?  
- Is there a clear rationale for each proposed change?  
- Have simulations or analyses been conducted to assess impacts?  

### For Software Upgrade Proposals:  

- What functional changes are being introduced?  
- Has the code been audited or reviewed?  
- Is there a rollback plan in case issues arise?  
- Are validators prepared for the upgrade?  

## Evaluate External Discussion  

- Has the proposal been discussed on Commonwealth, Discord, or other forums?  
- What feedback has been provided by community members?  
- Have technical experts or validators contributed their insights?  
- Have concerns raised been addressed by the proposer?  
- Is there a consensus or controversy surrounding the proposal?  

## Consider Long-term Implications  

- How does this proposal align with Babylon's long-term vision?  
- Could there be unintended consequences?  
- Does it impact the security or decentralization of the network?  
- Does it set precedents for future decisions?  
- How might it affect various stakeholder groups?  

## Check Technical Feasibility  

- Is the implementation realistic with current technology?  
- Are the resource requirements (computational, human, financial) reasonable?  
- Has similar functionality been successfully implemented elsewhere?  
- Is the proposed timeline realistic?  

## Voting Decision Framework

| Vote Option | When to Use | Impact |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Yes** | The proposal is sound, beneficial, and you support its implementation | Counts toward approval threshold |
| **No** | The proposal has issues or drawbacks, but you don't consider it harmful enough to veto | Counts toward rejection |
| **No With Veto** | The proposal is harmful, malicious, or against core principles | If >33.4% vote this way, proposal is rejected and deposit burned |
| **Abstain** | You've reviewed the proposal but prefer not to influence the Yes/No outcome | Contributes to quorum only |

### Special Considerations for Veto Votes  

The "No With Veto" option carries significant weight in Babylon Genesis' governance. Use this option when:  

- The proposal violates fundamental principles of the network  
- There is evidence of malicious intent  
- The proposal could harm the security or stability of the network  
- The proposal process was manipulated or circumvented proper discussion  

Remember that if >33.4% (1/3) of votes are "No With Veto," the proposal is rejected and the deposit is burned 100%.
