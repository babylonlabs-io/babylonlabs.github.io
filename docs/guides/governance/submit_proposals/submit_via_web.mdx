# On-chain Submission via Web  

Some explorer tools provide a graphic interface for stakeholders to submit governance proposals via web interface. Mintscan and L2Scan both provide these capabilities. This guide shows you how to complete such submissions online.  

## Prerequisites  

Create your BABY wallet by following instructions [here](https://babylon.foundation/docs/wallet-compatibilities).  

## Submit Proposal via Mintscan  

### Step 1: Connect Wallet  

Visit the "Create Proposal" page on mintscan: [https://www.mintscan.io/wallet/create-proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/wallet/create-proposal). Select your wallet type, sign when prompted to login.  

### Step 2: Select Proposal Type  

Click on "New Proposal". Select the proposal type from the available options:  

- Text Proposal  
- Parameter Change  
- Software Upgrade  
- Community Pool Spend  

### Step 3: Fill in Proposal Details  

- **Title:** Enter a clear, descriptive title  
- **Description:** Provide detailed information about your proposal  
- Add any relevant links or documentation  
- Specify the deposit amount (must meet minimum deposit requirement)  

### Step 4: Review and Submit

## Submit Proposal via L2Scan  

### Step 1: Login and Connect Wallet  

Visit the "Create Proposal" page on L2scan: [https://babylon-testnet.l2scan.co/create-proposal](https://babylon-testnet.l2scan.co/create-proposal). Click on "login" from top right corner. Select "connect wallet" then look for your wallet name before connecting. You will need to sign a message to sign in.  

### Step 2: Select Proposal Type  

While UI provides great convenience, most technically capable validators or stakers will mostly use CLI to interact with governance process.  

Click on "New Proposal". Select the proposal type from the available options:  

- Text  
- Software Upgrades  
- Community Pool Spend (which is not available)
