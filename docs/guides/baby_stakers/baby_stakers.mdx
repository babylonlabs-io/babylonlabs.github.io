# Staking BABY on Babylon

**BABY staking** is a native staking mechanism that secures the Babylon Genesis -
the first Bitcoin Secured Network and a Proof of Stake chain. This allows token
holders to delegate to a chain validator to accrue inflationary rewards
proportional to their stake. Alongside BTC staking on Finality Providers of
Babylon Genesis, it contributes to the chain’s security and decentralization.

## Benefits of BABY Staking

By staking BABY tokens, the delegator can:

- **Earn rewards**: Receive a portion of the annual inflation allocated to BABY
stakers.
- **Secure the network**: Contribute to the Babylon Genesis chain's security
and decentralization.
- **Fast unbonding**: Access a significantly reduced unbonding period of
approximately 2 days compared to the typical 21 days in most PoS chains.
- **Governance participation**: BABY staking gives stakers voting power in the
chain’s governance to help shape the future of the network.


## The Staking Process

When you have acquired BABY and decide to stake your BABY tokens, the general
process is as follows:

1. **Submission**: You send a BABY staking request through supported wallets.
2. **Confirmation**: The system confirms it received your request.
3. **Queuing**: Your request joins the queue, waiting for the current epoch to
end.
4. **Funds Status**: Important: Your funds remain available in your wallet
until the epoch ends.

## Slashing Conditions

Like all staking operations, BABY staking carries certain risks that delegators
should understand.

- Staked validators can only be slashed for double signing, which means
proposing two different blocks at the same height (considered a severe
security violation).
- When slashing occurs, 5% of the delegated tokens are slashed, while the
remaining 95% are returned to the BABY delegator.

Babylon implements several measures to protect BABY delegators:

- **On-chain Records**: All slashing events are recorded on-chain and visible
through explorers. Validator slashing history is publicly available to inform
delegation decisions.
- **Partial Slashing**: Calibrated slashing parameters in percentage help
protect delegators from catastrophic loss.

*More on the slashing conditions can be found [here](/guides/baby_stakers/staking_mechanism).*

## Fast Unbonding

Babylon Genesis employs the Bitcoin Timestamping protocol, which enables a
fast unbonding process:

### Unbonding Initiation:
- Delegator submits an unbonding request transaction.
- Request is queued for processing at the epoch boundary.
- At epoch conclusion, the token delegation status changes to "unbonding".

### Bitcoin Checkpoint Verification:
- The protocol commits a cryptographic hash of the Babylon Genesis chain
state to the Bitcoin blockchain.
- The system monitors the Bitcoin chain for confirmation of the block that
contains the checkpoint.
- Required confirmation depth: 300 Bitcoin blocks (~2 days).

### Token Release:
- Once Bitcoin confirmations reach the required threshold, tokens are
automatically released and returned to the delegator.
- Released tokens become fully liquid and transferable; there are no more
restrictions.

## Relationship with Bitcoin Staking

BABY staking operates alongside Babylon's Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Both
mechanisms contribute to securing the Babylon Genesis chain.Staking natively
allows Babylon Genesis validators to validate chain information, while BTC
staking allows Babylon Genesis Finality Providers to do the same.

This dual-staking model is the foundation of Babylon’s Bitcoin Secured
Network model, combining the robustness of Bitcoin with the efficiency of
Proof of Stake consensus.

Bitcoin staking delegators earn BABY rewards from a separate annual
inflation figure. However, they do not participate in the governance of
Babylon Genesis.

following sections will delve deeper into specific mechanisms, the unique fast
unbonding process, and practical guides to getting started with BABY staking.
