# Pioneer Pass NFT Campaign

The Pioneer Pass campaign is designed to reward and recognize early stakers within 
the Babylon BTC Stakers community. 

The primary goal of the Pioneer Pass campaign is to acknowledge and commemorate early 
adopters and stakers of the Babylon project.

Eligibility for owning a Pioneer Pass is open to anyone. The Pioneer Pass can be 
acquired on the Polygon NFT marketplace.

## Key Concepts

*   **Babylon Testnet:** A risk-free environment built on BTC Signet for testing Bitcoin staking.  
*   **BTC Signet:** A testing network for Bitcoin with 0-value tokens.  
*   **Bitcoin Pioneer Pass:** A commemorative NFT awarded to early participants in the Babylon testnet.  


## Specifications

*   **Token Standard:** ERC-721
*   **Network:** Polygon
*   **Contract Address:** `0x79c385C2A5bB9986824A54817c1EAF4b57F09f10`

The Pioneer Pass provides a utility boost within the airdrop campaign. Holders 
of the Pioneer Pass will receive a multiplier or bonus in the calculation of their 
airdrop allocation. The specific details of the boost will be announced separately 
for each airdrop campaign.

For details please refer to Babylon Foundation website: [https://www.babylon.foundation/](https://www.babylon.foundation/)

## Distribution

The Pioneer Pass is not directly distributed by the Babylon project. In the early stage, 
stakers can stake Signet BTC (testnet BTC that has no real value) and claim. At anytime, 
users can acquire the Pioneer Pass through NFT marketplaces that support the Polygon network.
