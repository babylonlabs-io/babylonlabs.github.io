# Bitcoin Native Staking via Web App

Self-custodial staking is a process where users can stake their Bitcoin without relying 
on a third party. The staker can participate in another network's validating activity 
whilst: 
- Maintaining direct control of their Bitcoin through their private keys
- Never transferring custody to third parties
- Using Bitcoin transactions to create time-locked, self-controlled staking contracts

The Bitcoin remains on the Bitcoin network and never leaves the staker's wallet. Only 
the voting power is delegated to the validator/Finality Provider. The staker can withdraw, 
or in other words unbond, their staked Bitcoin anytime without having to wait for a 
lengthy period. This gives freedom to Bitcoin holders to react to market conditions. 

This contrasts with custodial staking, wrapped or bridged Bitcoin where users must 
trust third parties with their Bitcoin. 

## Staking on Babylon

A Babylon-compatible Bitcoin wallet allows users to stake their Bitcoin directly 
on the Babylon Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Users will need to select a Finality Provider 
to delegate their voting power to and send the Bitcoin transaction through via the 
help of a staking web app or CLI. 

## Staking via web app
Staking via the Babylon web app is a simple process. 

1. Visit the [Babylon Staking](https://btcstaking.babylonlabs.io) app hosted by Babylon Labs.
2. Connect your Babylon-compatible Bitcoin wallet to the web app.
3. Select the Finality Provider you want to delegate your voting power to.
4. Sign all transactions related to staking.
