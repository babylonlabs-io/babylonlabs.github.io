# Bitcoin Timestamping Research Paper

### Abstract

Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain in the world,
supported by the immense hash power of its Proof-of-Work
miners. Proof-of-Stake chains are energy-efficient, have fast
finality but face several security issues: susceptibility to nonslashable long-range safety attacks, low liveness resilience and
difficulty to bootstrap from low token valuation. We show that
these security issues are inherent in any PoS chain without an
external trusted source, and propose a new protocol, Babylon,
where an off-the-shelf PoS protocol checkpoints onto Bitcoin to
resolve these issues. An impossibility result justifies the optimality
of Babylon. A use case of Babylon is to reduce the stake
withdrawal delay: our experimental results show that this delay
can be reduced from weeks in existing PoS chains to less than
5 hours using Babylon, at a transaction cost of less than 10K
USD per annum for posting the checkpoints onto Bitcoin.
