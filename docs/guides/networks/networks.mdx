# Networks

Babylon's protocol deployment follows a strategic phased approach across both testing and production environments.

### Testnet Environments

- Phase 1: Bitcoin staking test environment using BTC signet without the full Babylon Genesis chain.
- Phase 2: Complete Babylon Genesis testnet with validators, finality providers, and full staking functionality.
- Phase 3 (dev environments): Development networks for Bitcoin-secured Networks (BSNs) integration testing.

### Mainnet Implementation

The mainnet deployment progresses through similar phases with incremental feature releases, ultimately enabling Bitcoin's security to be shared across multiple blockchain networks. Phase 1 focuses on Bitcoin staking, Phase 2 launches the complete Genesis chain, and Phase 3 enables multi-staking to secure partner networks.
