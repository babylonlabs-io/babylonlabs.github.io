# Babylon Genesis Testnet Overview

Babylon Genesis Testnet is a public testing environment designed for developers and the community to safely explore, build, and experiment with the features of Babylon’s Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN) before mainnet deployment.

## What Can Developers Do on Babylon Testnet?

- **DApp Development**: Deploy and test EVM-compatible decentralized applications leveraging Babylon’s security framework and Cosmos SDK features.
- **BTC Staking Integration (Test Mode)**: Experiment with integrating Bitcoin staking mechanics (using test BTC) and delegate to simulated finality providers.
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Test interoperability features such as cross-chain asset transfers, messaging, and Bitcoin-based timestamping.
- **Validator & Finality Provider Operations**: Run validator nodes, participate in consensus, and simulate the role of a finality provider in a risk-free environment.
- **On-Chain Governance Simulation**: Propose and vote on protocol upgrades or parameter changes using testnet BABY tokens.
- **EVM Primitives**: Deploy and interact with DeFi primitives, such as swapping, lending, or liquid staking tokens—all on testnet BTC and BABY tokens.
- **APIs & SDKs**: Integrate and test API endpoints and SDK libraries for wallets, explorers, or custom integrations.

## Why Use Babylon Genesis Testnet?

- Safe testing, experimentation, and debugging before mainnet deployment
- Early access to new protocol features and upgrades
- Collaboration and feedback channels with the Babylon core development team
