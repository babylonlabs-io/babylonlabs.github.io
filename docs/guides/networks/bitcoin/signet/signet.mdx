# Bitcoin Signet

Bitcoin Signet is Bitcoin's public test network for safely testing Bitcoin-related functionality without using real BTC. It mirrors mainnet behavior while providing a controlled environment for development and verification, with transactions recorded on a separate test ledger and full Bitcoin scripting available for contract experimentation.
