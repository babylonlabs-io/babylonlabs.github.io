# Phase 1: Testnet

Phase 1 testnet focuses on the security of the staked BTC.

The Phase 1 Testnet (bbn-test-4) focuses on the security of the staked 
Bitcoins by only testing the userâ€™s interaction with the BTC signet 
network. This will be a lock-only network without the Babylon Genesis 
chain operating, meaning that the only participants of this testnet 
will be Finality Providers and Bitcoin stakers.

Since there is no PoS chain to store system information. Such 
information includes:

- **Finality Providers Information** which contains additional information about Finality Providers participating in the system such as their monikers, committed commission, and other identifying information. Finality Providers wishing to register more information about themselves to display on the testnet web interfaces, should submit their information there.

**Registration is turned off** for the current testnet, you can still test the creation and check if everything worked properly with the scripts.

- **System parameters** which are versioned parameters denoting what constitutes a valid stake that is accepted by the lock-only staking system. These parameters are timestamped on Bitcoin for easy verification.

- **Integration** which contains information on wallet integration on the testnet system and operating a staking provider back-end.

- **Covenant Committee** which contains information about the covenant emulation committee.

Following is information related to this system:
