# Babylon Genesis Mainnet Overview

Babylon Genesis is the world's first  Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN), acting as the control plane for security and liquidity orchestration across the Babylon ecosystem.

## What Makes Babylon Genesis Unique?

Built on the Cosmos SDK framework, Babylon Genesis introduces three key innovations:

### 1. Bitcoin Staking
- **Self-Custodial Staking**: BTC holders can stake assets directly, maintaining full custody—no wrapping or bridges required.
- **Dual Quorum**: BTC stakers delegate to finality providers for cross-chain security, while BABY token stakers delegate to Cosmos validators for network governance and consensus.

### 2. Bitcoin Timestamping
- **Immutable Anchoring**: Events from other blockchains are timestamped on Bitcoin, enhancing security and data integrity.
- **Advanced PoS Security**: Protects against long-range attacks by anchoring states to Bitcoin's ledger.

### 3. Control Plane for the Babylon Ecosystem
- **Orchestrating Security & Liquidity**: Babylon Genesis will coordinate both economic security and liquidity for the entire Babylon ecosystem, supporting robust EVM primitives and cross-network incentives via the BABY token.

BABY is the native token of Babylon Genesis, used for staking, governance, and transaction fees—and also for distributing ecosystem rewards and incentives to attract growth and developers.

## Current On-chain Ecosystem

Babylon Genesis's mainnet ecosystem is rapidly expanding. Some notable activities and applications include:

- **BTC Staking**: Over 57,000 BTC (≈$6.1 billion value at the time) have already been staked by early adopters, making Bitcoin a top-10 staking asset globally, with huge growth potential ahead.
- **Bitcoin-Backed Security**: Finality Providers use staked BTC to secure Babylon Genesis and demonstrate advanced security that can be exported to other networks in future phases.
- **Active Governance**: The BABY token enables decentralized protocol governance, giving the community a direct role in protocol evolution.
- **EVM-Compatible dApps**: Babylon's EVM layer is currently under development and is planned for a future release. Once available, developers will be able to deploy DeFi primitives—such as liquid staking tokens (LSTs), decentralized exchanges, and lending protocols—anchored by Bitcoin-level security. Please refer to the [Babylon roadmap](https://docs.babylonchain.io/roadmap) for updates on EVM compatibility.
- **Cross-chain Integrations**: Upcoming partnerships and technical integrations will onboard new L1s, rollups, and DeFi protocols as part of the expanding Babylon ecosystem.

> Ancient Babylon was a vibrant center for trade, culture, and innovation, uniting economies through a central marketplace. Babylon Genesis aims to do the same for web3: unlocking Bitcoin's security, liquidity, and community for a decentralized future.
