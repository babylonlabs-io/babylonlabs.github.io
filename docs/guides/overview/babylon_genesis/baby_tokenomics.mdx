## The Role of BABY in Babylon Genesis

BABY is the native token of Babylon Genesis. It will play a critical role in transactions, 
governance, and security within the ecosystem.

BABY serves as the gas token for Babylon Genesis, facilitating transactions and smart 
contract execution. It also enables governance, allowing token holders and their delegated 
validators to vote on protocol changes and network upgrades.

## Dual Staking & Security Model

Babylon Genesis employs a dual staking model, utilizing both BABY and BTC to strengthen 
network security. Both Bitcoin stakers and BABY stakers contribute security and receive 
BABY rewards. This mechanism promotes long-term participation, supporting a sustainable 
security framework for the Babylon ecosystem.

By utilizing BABY tokens, Babylon Genesis aligns incentives across validators, Bitcoin 
stakers, and governance participants, positioning it to be a robust and decentralized 
Bitcoin Supercharged Network.

## Token Distribution

Below is a breakdown of the planned allocation of 10,000,000,000 BABY tokens across

and the names of the categories may change, provided that no additional allocation will 
be taken from other categories to be given to early team members, investors or advisors.

### Community Incentives (15%)
To encourage participation in the Babylon ecosystem, 1.5 billion BABY tokens have been 
allocated for community incentives. These tokens, managed by the Babylon Foundation, are 
not locked and can be distributed at any time. Up to 400 million BABY tokens can be 
staked within this category, and any staking rewards will be attributed back to this 
category.

### Ecosystem Building (18%)
To foster ecosystem growth, 1.8 billion BABY tokens (18%) have been allocated for grants, 
bounties, investments, marketing and acquisitions. These tokens will be unlocked over 3 
years, with 25% unlocked at the Babylon Genesis network launch, and the rest unlocked 
linearly starting at the first anniversary of network launch.

Up to 800 million BABY tokens from this category can be staked, and any staking rewards 
will be attributed back to this category.

### Research and Development + Operations (18%)
A total of 1.8 billion BABY tokens have been allocated to fund the operations of the 
Foundation as well as research and development activities for protocol and infrastructure 
development and advancing native use cases of Bitcoin. These tokens will be unlocked over 
3 years, with 25% unlocked at the network launch, and the rest unlocked linearly starting 
at the first anniversary of network launch.

The Babylon Foundation has the flexibility to reallocate unlocked tokens from this 
category to support Community Incentives or Ecosystem Building if needed. Up to 800 million 
BABY tokens from this allocation can be staked, and staking rewards will be attributed 
back to this category.

### Early Private-Round Investors (30.5%)
Early investors in Babylon are allocated 3.05 billion BABY tokens, following a 4-year 
unlocking schedule. The first unlocking event occurs on the first anniversary of the 
network launch, releasing 12.5% of the total allocation. The remaining tokens unlock 
linearly over 3 years. Investors cannot stake locked tokens in the first year. After the 
first year, the locked tokens can be staked.

### Team (15%)
1.5 billion BABY tokens are allocated to the core Babylon team members. These tokens 
follow a 4-year vesting schedule, with a 1-year cliff followed by linear vesting of the 
remaining 3 years. Unvested tokens cannot be staked.

Vested tokens are subject to a 4-year unlocking schedule. The first unlocking event occurs 
on the first anniversary of the network launch, or one year service anniversary, whichever 
is later. This first unlock releases 12.5% of the total allocation. The remaining tokens 
unlock linearly over 3 years. Team members cannot stake locked tokens in the first year. 
After that, the locked tokens can be staked.

### Advisors (3.5%)
350 million BABY tokens are allocated to advisors, following individual vesting schedules 
and the same 4-year unlocking schedule as the team. Unvested tokens cannot be staked. 
Advisors cannot stake locked tokens in the first year. After that, the locked tokens can 
be staked.
