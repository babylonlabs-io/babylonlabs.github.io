# Architecture

The Babylon network has a layered architecture composed of Bitcoin scripts, Babylon node
built on Cosmos SDK, Finality Providers, and peripheral software solutions that
are designed to securely interact with Bitcoin Chain so it can facilitate Bitcoin staking.

On the top layer, Babylon ensures Bitcoin Chain and Babylon Genesis are securely connected 
and synchronized by using Checkpointing. It also keeps track of Bitcoin holders' staking 
transactions with a BTC staking monitor and indexer. The Vigilante network is used to 
monitor the Bitcoin Chain and Babylon Genesis for any malicious activities. Anyone can run 
these nodes and help maintain the security of the network.

The middle layer is the Babylon node. It is built on Cosmos SDK and implements the 
Babylon Bitcoin staking logic. It implements the eight core modules of: Babylon 
Epoching, Checkpointing, BTC Checkpointing, BTC Light Client, Zone Concierge, BTC 
Staking, Finality, and Rewards. It also includes the Babylon Genesis and the Validators and Finality Providers set and runs on CometBFT for consensus.

At the bottom layer, EOTS Manager and Finality Provider nodes provide the means for 
group signatures and validating the data of an external network. Covenant Emulator 
provides enforcements on the transaction data for staking, unbonding and slashing. The 
IBC relayer and Babylon Contracts, which are usually implemented by BSNs consuming 
Bitcoin security help to communicate and standardize the data exchange between them.
