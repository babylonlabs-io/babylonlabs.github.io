# Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSNs)

A BSN is any PoS chain that needs to ensure its blocks are final and 
unchangeable using Bitcoin as stake. To integrate with Babylon, BSNs 
need to implement several key modules: 
* a Bitcoin light client for verifying Bitcoin transactions, 
* a BTC timestamping module for securing data with Bitcoin-based timestamps, 
* a BTC staking module for managing staked Bitcoin and finality providers, 
* a finality module for handling the consensus process, 
* a relayer for facilitating communication between Babylon and the BSN,  ensuring timely message delivery.

BSNs have several advantages: 
- *Security*: BSNs inherit Bitcoin's security without relying on third parties or bridges.
- *Decentralization*: BSNs tap into Bitcoin, the most decentralized network to become more 
resilient and resistant to censorship.
- *Liquidity*: BSNs can benefit from Bitcoin's trillions of dollars in idle liquidity.
- *Fast finality*: Transactions on BSNs can benefit from quicker finality times.

## Who are BSNs?
Upon the mainnet launch of Babylon's Phase 2, Babylon Genesis (built on Cosmos SDK) will be 
the first BSN. Accepting delegations from Bitcoin stakers, Babylon Genesis will be able to 
provide blockchain finality to itself and to any decentralized applications (dApps) that 
are built on it.

In [Phase 3](/guides/overview/phases_of_the_launch/phase-3) of Babylon mainnet, Babylon will gradually and carefully 
introduce new BSNs to the ecosytem. This will allow other PoS blockchains to enhance their 
security and decentralization. 

Babylon developed solutions for: 
* Cosmos-based networks
* OP Stack L2 networks
* Arbitrum L2 networks

and many more in the pipeline. PoS chains are the most common type of BSNs that will understand
the value of economic security Bitcoin can provide. 

## Building a BSN
Building a BSN takes a considerable amount of time and resources. It requires 
understanding of Bitcoin chain, inter-chain communication, and the existing consensus 
and reward mechanisms. Babylon Labs provides a comprehensive suite of tools, documentation, 
reference implementation and business support to help you become a BSN.

Before integration starts, there will be research, integration and development work needed. 
Discussions on economic impact and social impact of the integration should also be in place. 
The BSNs, if it is an existing chain, will likely need to go through a governance process to 
accept the integration. Likewise, the Babylon committee will also need to go through a 
governance process to accept the integration.

## BSN Categories
BSN architecture is flexible and allows for a wide range of chains to be integrated. 
Examples of these chains include layer 1 public blockchains, permissioned blockchains, 
layer 2 rollup chains, privacy preserving zkp chains, and more.

The key categories of BSNs are:

    }}
  />

Each BSN can modify its consensus mechanism by using Babylon as an additional 
security layer through Bitcoin staking. The modular design allows for 
flexible integration with various system architectures without requiring fundamental 
changes to the core application of a chain, thus allowing Bitcoin security to be more ubiquitous in 
blockchain networks.
