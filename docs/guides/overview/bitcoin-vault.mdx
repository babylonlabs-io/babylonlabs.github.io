## The Problem

Only ~1% of Bitcoin participates in DeFi today. Why? Because traditional approaches
require Bitcoin holders to surrender their native Bitcoin to a custodian (bridge,
wrapper, or validator set) in exchange for synthetic tokens. This custodian has
full control and can potentially seize the assets—an unacceptable trust requirement
for most Bitcoin holders.

## The Solution

Trustless Bitcoin Vault (TBV) is a protocol that enables native Bitcoin to participate
in DeFi **without bridges, wrappers, or trusted custodians**. Your Bitcoin stays on
the Bitcoin blockchain in a self-custodial vault while smart contracts on DeFi chains
can programmably control its ownership.

With TBV, using native Bitcoin in DeFi becomes as safe as using ETH in DeFi.

## What is a Vault?

A vault is **not** a shared capital pool. In TBV:

- **Your Bitcoin stays on Bitcoin**: Locked in a Bitcoin script you create—no bridging
  or wrapping into synthetic tokens
- **Segregated, not pooled**: Each vault is isolated. Your Bitcoin is never co-mingled
  with others' funds
- **No rehypothecation**: Your vault cannot be used by anyone else as their collateral
- **Programmable ownership**: Smart contracts define who can claim your Bitcoin and
  under what conditions

## Use Cases

TBV transforms Bitcoin into programmable collateral for any DeFi application:

- **Bitcoin-backed lending**: Use BTC as collateral for loans without giving up custody
- **Bitcoin-backed stablecoins**: Mint stablecoins with native BTC backing
- **Bitcoin options**: Collateralize call/put options with your Bitcoin
- **Insurance**: Use BTC as reserve capital for on-chain insurance products

## How It Works

TBV uses cryptographic techniques to translate DeFi smart contract execution into
something the Bitcoin blockchain can understand and act upon:

- **Zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs)** verify that smart contract conditions were met
- **Bitcoin scripts** enforce the ownership rules on the Bitcoin side
- **Challenge mechanisms** ensure fraudulent claims can be disputed

The result: ownership transfers are enforced by cryptographic proofs and code, not
trusted parties.

## Why It's Trustless

What you do NOT need to trust:
- **Custodians or bridges**: There are none. Your Bitcoin is self-custodied
- **Indexer nodes**: A compromised indexer cannot steal funds—proofs validate the data
- **Prover operators**: A malicious prover cannot produce a valid proof for a false claim

What you DO need to trust (minimal surface):
- **The DeFi chain**: Its consensus must execute the smart contracts correctly
- **Verification parameters**: The cryptographic setup must be generated transparently

## Architecture

</div>

The system is composed of modular, decoupled components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Indexer** | Tracks Bitcoin network state (blocks, transactions, UTXOs) |
| **Prover** | Generates zero-knowledge proofs that smart contracts can verify |
| **Vault Contracts** | Verifies proofs on the DeFi chain and enforces ownership rules |
| **Core Runtime** | Coordinates vault creation, key management, and proof workflows |

## Security

TBV is designed to minimize attack surface:

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Forged proofs | Contracts cryptographically verify all proofs; invalid proofs are rejected |
| Compromised indexer | Multiple indexers can cross-validate; provers verify data consistency |
| Chain reorganizations | Proofs include block height checks; contracts require sufficient confirmations |
| Malicious claims | Challenge period allows disputes; fraudulent claims can be blocked |
