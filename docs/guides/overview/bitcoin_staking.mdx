# Bitcoin Staking

Bitcoin staking in Babylon protocol enables BTC holders to lock their assets in a 
time-bound contract as security collateral, earning rewards for securing any networks. 
The protocol implements a slashing mechanism where staked assets may be forfeited if 
protocol security rules are violated, similar to traditional security deposits but 
with protocol-enforced penalties. Networks consuming such a security are called 
Bitcoin Supercharged Networks (BSNs).

## Native Bitcoin Staking Implementation

Babylon's staking mechanism is built directly on Bitcoin's UTXO model and native 
scripting capabilities. This differs from traditional cross-chain staking solutions 
that require wrapping or bridging Bitcoin to external networks.

### Core Requirements

For protocol security, Bitcoin staking implements the following attributes:
- Self-custody: Stakers maintain direct control of their Bitcoin
- Trustless execution: No reliance on third parties
- Native operation: Direct integration with Bitcoin blockchain
- Slashing capability: Protocol-enforced penalties for malicious behavior

### Technical Implementation

The staking mechanism leverages Bitcoin's UTXO model, allowing holders to create 
multiple UTXOs with distinct spending conditions defined through Bitcoin scripts. 
These scripts form the basis of staking contracts with the following conditions:

1. Holder's cryptographic signature
2. Time-lock expiration
3. Covenant committee consensus (for slashing)

The protocol introduces Extractable One-Time Signatures (EOTS) and a covenant 
committee to enable slashing functionality. The committee can execute slashing 
through majority consensus if malicious behavior is detected, resulting in partial 
or complete forfeiture of staked assets.

The Babylon Staking Protocol maintains an index of staked Bitcoin by monitoring 
and validating transactions between Bitcoin Chain and Babylon Genesis, enabling 
programmatic security for connected BSNs.

## Multi-Staking Architecture

Bitcoin Multi-Staking enables BTC holders to delegate their assets across multiple 
Finality Providers and BSNs. This architecture forms the foundation of Babylon's 
shared security model, allowing stakers to diversify their delegation while 
maximizing rewards from multiple BSNs.

### Protocol Components

The multi-staking architecture consists of:
1. Staking Contract: Bitcoin script-based security mechanism with covenant committee 
   integration, facilitated via Babylon Genesis
2. Finality Provider: Delegated validators for BSN chain or data validation
3. BSNs: Bitcoin Supercharged Networks utilizing the multi-staking infrastructure

### Security Properties

The shared security model provides:
1. Slashable PoS Security: Guaranteed partial stake forfeiture upon safety 
   violations, with chain-specific slashing isolation
2. Asset Safety: Guaranteed withdrawal capability for honest stakers and validators
3. Liquidity Assurance: Secure, efficient unbonding without social consensus 
   requirements
4. Security Isolation: Chain-specific security boundaries prevent cross-chain 
   contamination

### Protocol Benefits

This architecture optimizes Bitcoin's utility as security collateral without 
requiring additional capital allocation. It addresses the cold-start problem faced 
by new blockchain networks in bootstrapping security capital and trust. The shared 
slashing mechanism across networks creates strong security incentives, as malicious 
behavior results in stake loss across all delegated networks.
