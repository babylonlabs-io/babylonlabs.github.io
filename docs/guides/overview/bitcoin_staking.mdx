# Bitcoin Staking

Bitcoin staking in Babylon protocol enables BTC holders to lock their assets in a
time-bound contract as security collateral, earning rewards for securing networks.
The protocol implements a slashing mechanism where staked assets may be forfeited if
protocol security rules are violated, similar to traditional security deposits but
with protocol-enforced penalties.

## Native Bitcoin Staking Implementation

Babylon's staking mechanism is built directly on Bitcoin's UTXO model and native
scripting capabilities. This differs from traditional cross-chain staking solutions
that require wrapping or bridging Bitcoin to external networks.

### Core Requirements

For protocol security, Bitcoin staking implements the following attributes:
- Self-custody: Stakers maintain direct control of their Bitcoin
- Trustless execution: No reliance on third parties
- Native operation: Direct integration with Bitcoin blockchain
- Slashing capability: Protocol-enforced penalties for malicious behavior

### Technical Implementation

The staking mechanism leverages Bitcoin's UTXO model, allowing holders to create
multiple UTXOs with distinct spending conditions defined through Bitcoin scripts.
These scripts form the basis of staking contracts with the following conditions:

1. Holder's cryptographic signature
2. Time-lock expiration
3. Covenant committee consensus (for slashing)

The protocol introduces Extractable One-Time Signatures (EOTS) and a covenant
committee to enable slashing functionality. The committee can execute slashing
through majority consensus if malicious behavior is detected, resulting in partial
or complete forfeiture of staked assets.

  <em>Babylon Staking Protocol Architecture</em><br/>
</div>

The Babylon Staking Protocol maintains an index of staked Bitcoin by monitoring
and validating transactions between Bitcoin Chain and Babylon Genesis.

## Staking Architecture

Bitcoin Staking enables BTC holders to delegate their assets to Finality Providers.
This architecture forms the foundation of Babylon's security model, allowing stakers
to participate in securing the network while earning rewards.

### Protocol Components

The staking architecture consists of:
1. **Staking Contract**: Bitcoin script-based security mechanism with covenant
   committee integration, facilitated via Babylon Genesis
2. **Finality Provider**: Delegated validators for chain or data validation
3. **Babylon Genesis**: Coordination layer that tracks staking state and
   distributes rewards

### Security Properties

The security model provides:
1. **Slashable PoS Security**: Guaranteed partial stake forfeiture upon safety
   violations
2. **Asset Safety**: Guaranteed withdrawal capability for honest stakers and
   validators
3. **Liquidity Assurance**: Secure, efficient unbonding without social consensus
   requirements

### Protocol Benefits

This architecture optimizes Bitcoin's utility as security collateral without
requiring additional capital allocation. It addresses the cold-start problem faced
by new blockchain networks in bootstrapping security capital and trust. The
slashing mechanism creates strong security incentives, as malicious behavior
results in stake loss.
