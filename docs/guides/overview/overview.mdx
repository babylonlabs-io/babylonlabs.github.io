# Babylon Protocol Overview

Babylon provides Bitcoin-native infrastructure for the decentralized economy.
Our protocol enables trustless interaction with Bitcoin state and native
Bitcoin staking directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Trustless Bitcoin Vault

Only ~1% of Bitcoin participates in DeFi today. The reason? Traditional
approaches require Bitcoin holders to trust custodians or bridges that
can seize their assets. Trustless Bitcoin Vault (TBV) changes this.

TBV is a protocol that allows native Bitcoin to be used in DeFi products
**without bridging, wrapping, or trusting any third party**. Your Bitcoin
stays on the Bitcoin blockchain in a self-custodial vault that you create
and control—but smart contracts on other chains can programmably determine
who owns it.

Key benefits:
- **Self-custodial**: Your Bitcoin remains in your vault on the Bitcoin
  blockchain. No synthetic tokens, no custodians
- **Trustless**: Ownership transfers are enforced by cryptographic proofs
  and code, not trusted intermediaries
- **Segregated**: Each vault is isolated—no pooling, no co-mingling, no
  rehypothecation of your assets
- **Programmable**: Smart contracts define the conditions under which
  your Bitcoin can be claimed, enabling complex DeFi logic

This unlocks Bitcoin-native DeFi: lending with BTC collateral, Bitcoin-backed
stablecoins, options, insurance, and more—all while maintaining the security
guarantees Bitcoin holders expect.

## Bitcoin Staking

Babylon enables native bitcoin staking directly on the Bitcoin blockchain
without intermediaries. The protocol implements trustless Bitcoin staking with
efficient unbonding periods through cryptographic primitives and protocol-level
innovations.

Key features:
- **Trustless staking**: BTC remains native with no wrapped assets
- **Self-custody**: Stakers maintain direct control of their Bitcoin
- **Fast unbonding**: Stake withdrawal period of just a few days
- **Slashing capability**: Protocol-enforced penalties for security violations

When implemented at scale, Bitcoin represents the largest potential staking
capital pool in the web3 ecosystem.

## Security Model

Babylon implements the following security guarantees:

- **PoS Security**: Security violations trigger automatic slashing of a portion
  of the Bitcoin stake
- **Staker's Security**: Staked Bitcoin remains recoverable contingent on
  network compliance by the staker or delegated validator
- **Withdrawal Assurance**: Unbonding operations execute securely without
  requiring consensus coordination

## Babylon Genesis

Babylon Genesis is a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain that serves as the
coordination layer for the Babylon protocol. It provides native IBC
(Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol support and CosmWasm compatibility
for smart contract deployment.
