# Babylon Protocol Overview

Babylon provides Bitcoin-native infrastructure for the decentralized economy.
Our protocol enables trustless interaction with Bitcoin state and native
Bitcoin staking directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Trustless Bitcoin Vault

Trustless Bitcoin Vault is a toolkit that securely connects Bitcoin on-chain state to
external smart contracts (e.g. Ethereum) and systems. By combining on-chain contracts,
light-client proofs (ZK SNARKs), and independent indexers, it enables verifying
Bitcoin consensus and UTXO state in other chains or applications without
trusting any single third party.

Key capabilities:
- **Trustless verification**: No need to trust individual nodes or custodians;
  security is enforced by cryptographic proofs and on-chain rules
- **Verifiable light clients**: Provide provable, compact attestations of
  Bitcoin consensus to target chains
- **Modular architecture**: Indexer, prover, and contract layers are separated
  so each can be swapped or upgraded independently

## Bitcoin Staking

Babylon enables native bitcoin staking directly on the Bitcoin blockchain
without intermediaries. The protocol implements trustless Bitcoin staking with
efficient unbonding periods through cryptographic primitives and protocol-level
innovations.

Key features:
- **Trustless staking**: BTC remains native with no wrapped assets
- **Self-custody**: Stakers maintain direct control of their Bitcoin
- **Fast unbonding**: Stake withdrawal period of just a few days
- **Slashing capability**: Protocol-enforced penalties for security violations

When implemented at scale, Bitcoin represents the largest potential staking
capital pool in the web3 ecosystem.

## Security Model

Babylon implements the following security guarantees:

- **PoS Security**: Security violations trigger automatic slashing of a portion
  of the Bitcoin stake
- **Staker's Security**: Staked Bitcoin remains recoverable contingent on
  network compliance by the staker or delegated validator
- **Withdrawal Assurance**: Unbonding operations execute securely without
  requiring consensus coordination

## Babylon Genesis

Babylon Genesis is a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain that serves as the
coordination layer for the Babylon protocol. It provides native IBC
(Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol support and CosmWasm compatibility
for smart contract deployment.
