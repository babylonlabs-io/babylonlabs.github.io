# Phase 3: Bitcoin Multi-staking

Phase 3 will transform Babylon's staked BTC into universal security assets across multiple decentralized networks simultaneously.

At its core, Babylon uses an advanced implementation of multiple EOTS keys to provide a secure and programmable mechanism to prevent equivocation in any data-driven platform or BSNs. For PoS chains, this ensures that blocks are finalized with no risk of double-signing by its validators.

Sophisticated cross-chain communication and time synchronization are required for BSNs to implement BTC staking. Babylon Genesis manages these complicated interactions and ensures proper coordination events happen on multiple networks.  

The final phase establishes Babylon as a marketplace for shared security. Babylon Genesis will be the control plane to coordinate security arrangements between stakers and BSNs.
