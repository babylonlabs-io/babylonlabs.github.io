# Phase 2: Babylon Genesis Launch

In this Phase, Babylon will focus on enabling Bitcoin staking and launching the Babylon Genesis. This includes complete feature implementation on the Babylon node (slashing & rewards), dashboard and API services, scalable infrastructure deployments, staker registration, Finality Providers coordination, and wallet support. 

The launch of the chain consists of the following: 
- Launch of stable Phase 2 testnet
- Mainnet launch: Babylon Genesis and software rollout
- Finality Providers start signing and begin block production
- Stakers register their Phase 1 stakes
- Token Generation Event (TGE) 
- Airdrop distribution to qualified participants

The network will progressively expand to include more Finality Providers to decentralize the network further.
