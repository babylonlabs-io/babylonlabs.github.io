# Unbond via CLI
## 1. Prerequisites
Bitcoin Node Setup
You need to have a running Bitcoin node `bitcoind`. You should also have a legacy wallet loaded on Bitcoin mainnet. Babylond will also need to be on the same network. You can configure the stakerd daemon to connect to either `bitcoind` or `btcd` node types, but `bitcoind` is preferred.

To set up the Bitcoin node:

Download and Extract:
```shell
# Download Bitcoin Core binary
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin - core - 26.0/bitcoin - 26.0 - x86_64 - linux - gnu.tar.gz

# Extract the downloaded archive
tar -xvf bitcoin - 26.0 - x86_64 - linux - gnu.tar.gz

# Provide execution permissions to binaries
chmod +x bitcoin - 26.0/bin/bitcoind
chmod +x bitcoin - 26.0/bin/bitcoin - cli
```
Create and Start Systemd Service: Update the following configurations in the provided file. Replace ```your_rpc_username``` and ```your_rpc_password``` with your own values. Set ```user``` to the machine user (e.g., ubuntu). Note that deprecatedrpc = create_bdb is necessary for creating a legacy wallet. You can add rpcallowip = 0.000.0/0 and rpcbind = 0.000.0 to enable remote connections and start bitcoind with -txindex option.
```shell
# Create the service file
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/bitcoind.service >/dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=bitcoin mainnet node
After=network.target

EOF
# Start the service
sudo systemctl daemon - reload
sudo systemctl enable bitcoind
sudo systemctl start bitcoind
# Check the status and logs of the service
systemctl status bitcoind
journalctl -u bitcoind -f
```
Create Legacy Wallet:
```shell
~/bitcoin - 26.0/bin/bitcoin - cli - mainnet \
    -rpcuser=<your_rpc_username> \
    -rpcpassword=<your_rpc_password> \
    -rpcport=8332 \
    -named createwallet \
    wallet_name=btcstaker \
    passphrase="<passphrase>" \
    load_on_startup=true \
    descriptors=false
```
Load Wallet:
```shell
~/bitcoin - 26.0/bin/bitcoin - cli - mainnet \
    -rpcuser=<your_rpc_username> \
    -rpcpassword=<your_rpc_password> \
    -rpcport=8332 \
    loadwallet "btcstaker"
 ```
BTC Staker Installation
This project requires Go version 1.21 or later. Install Go by following the official Go installation guide.
Install essential tools:
```shell
sudo apt install build - essential
```
Download the code:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/babylonlabs - io/btc - staker.git
cd btc - staker
git checkout <release - tag>
```
Build and install the binary:
```shell
make install
```
If your shell cannot find the installed binaries, add $GOPATH/bin to the $PATH:
```shell
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
```
Create a Babylon Keyring
The stakerd daemon requires a keyring with loaded Babylon tokens to pay for transactions. Follow this guide to create a keyring and request funds.
BTC Staker Setup
Staker Daemon Configuration: Initialize the home directory and dump the default configuration file:
```shell
stakercli admin dump - config --config - file - dir /path/to/stakerd - home/
Important Configuration Parameters:
Babylon Configuration:
<plaintext>
[babylon]
# Name of the key in the keyring to use for signing transactions
Key = btc - staker

# Chain id of the chain (Babylon)
ChainID = bbn - main

# Address of the chain's RPC server (Babylon)
RPCAddr = http://localhost:26657

# Address of the chain's GRPC server (Babylon)
GRPCAddr = https://localhost:9090

# Directory to store staker keys in
KeyDirectory = /path/to/stakerd - home/
</plaintext>
BTC Node Configuration:
<plaintext>
[chain]
# btc network to run on
Network = mainnet

[btcnodebackend]
# type of node to connect to {bitcoind, btcd}
Nodetype = bitcoind

# type of wallet to connect to {bitcoind, btcwallet}
WalletType = bitcoind

# fee mode to use for fee estimation {static, dynamic}. In dynamic mode fee will be estimated using backend node
FeeMode = static
</plaintext>
BTC Wallet Configuration:
<plaintext>
[walletconfig]
# name of the wallet to sign Bitcoin transactions.
# this should be the same as set in createwallet command in bitcoind.
WalletName = btcstaker

# passphrase to unlock the wallet
WalletPass = walletpass

[walletrpcconfig]
# location of the wallet rpc server
# note: in case of bitcoind, the wallet host is same as the rpc host
Host = localhost:8332

# user auth for the wallet rpc server
# note: in case of bitcoind, the wallet rpc credentials are same as rpc credentials
# this should be the same as set in the bitcoind daemon
User = your_rpc_username

# password auth for the wallet rpc server. This should be the same as set in the bitcoind daemon
Pass = your_rpc_password

# disables tls for the wallet rpc client
DisableTls = true
</plaintext>
BTC Node Type Specific Configuration:
<plaintext>
[bitcoind]
# The daemon's rpc listening address
# note: P2P port for mainnet is 8332/8333
# ref - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/03752444cd54df05a731557968d5a9f33a55c55c/src/chainparamsbase.cpp#L39

</plaintext>
BTC Staker Environment Configuration:
```shell
Create a .env file in the same directory as the binaries with BTCSTAKER_USERNAME and BTCSTAKER_PASSWORD for secure communication between the Staker Daemon and stakercli.
```
## 2. Unbonding BTC Stakes
The unbond command initiates the unbonding procedure, which involves communication with the Babylon chain, Covenant Emulators, and the Bitcoin blockchain. It builds the unbonding transaction, sends it to the Babylon Genesis chain, waits for signatures from the Covenant Emulators, and then sends the transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.

To use the unbond command, you need the `--staking-transaction-hash`, which is the transaction hash from the response of the stake command.

```shell
stakercli daemon unbond \
  --staking-transaction-hash `your_staking_transaction_hash`
```
Replace `your_staking_transaction_hash` with the actual transaction hash you received when you staked your Bitcoin. For example:
```shell
stakercli daemon unbond \
  --staking - transaction - hash 6bf442a2e864172cba73f642ced10c178f6b19097abde41608035fb26a601b10
```

## 3. Additional Functionality

### List Staking Transactions
You can use the following command to get the list of all staking transactions in the database:
```shell
stakercli daemon list - staking - transactions
```
### Minimum Unbonding Time
There is a minimum unbonding time currently set to 1008 BTC blocks. After this period, the unbonding timelock will expire, and the staked funds will be unbonded. You can monitor the progress of the Bitcoin blocks in the `bitcoind` systemd logs using `journalctl -u bitcoind -f` or by comparing the latest block in your node with a BTC explorer like `https://mempool.space/mainnet`.

## 5. Troubleshooting
Gas - related Errors
If you encounter gas - related errors during the unbonding operation, consider adjusting the `GasAdjustment` and `GasPrices` parameters in the `stakerd.conf` file. For example:

<plaintext>
GasAdjustment = 1.5
GasPrices = 0.002ubbn
</plaintext>

### Communication Issues
Ensure all configuration settings in the `stakerd.conf` file are correct, including RPC and GRPC addresses, wallet credentials, and network settings.

### Withdraw staked BTC
The staker can withdraw the staked funds after the timelock of the staking or unbonding transaction expires. Use the `--staking-transaction-hash` from the response of the stake command.

```shell
stakercli daemon unstake \
  --staking - transaction - hash `your_staking_transaction_hash`
```
Replace `your_staking_transaction_hash` with the actual transaction hash. For example:
```shell
stakercli daemon unstake \
  --staking - transaction - hash 6bf442a2e864172cba73f642ced10c178f6b19097abde41608035fb26a601b10
```
Note: You can also use this command to get the list of all withdrawable staking transactions in the database.
```shell
stakercli daemon withdrawable - transactions
```

To unstake, you need to wait for your staking/unbonding transaction to be deep enough in the Bitcoin blockchain so that the timelock expires.

:::note
Unbonding before completing the 100 - day period will make you ineligible for the bonus airdrop. Make sure to carefully consider your decision to unbond, especially if you are aiming to receive the bonus airdrop as part of your staking rewards.
