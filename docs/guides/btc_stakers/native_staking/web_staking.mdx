# Staking via web app

Babylon Labs provides a web dApp (BTC Staking Dashboard) for staking BTC to the Babylon Genesis chain.
Following is a step by step guide to stake BTC using the dashboard.

## 1. For Phase 1 Stakers
### How to register your Phase 1 stake to Phase 2

According to the requirements set by the Babylon Foundation, you must convert your Phase 1 staking to 
Phase 2 in order to start earning BABY staking rewards or qualify for any additional airdrops. 
The process is as follows:

#### Step 1: Access the Staking Dashboard
Visit the [Babylon Staking](https://btcstaking.babylonlabs.io/) website.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/web_app_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

#### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
Connect your [compatible wallet](/guides/btc_stakers/native_staking/web_staking/#compatible-wallets) 
compatible wallet to continue with the staking operation.

    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/4.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/4_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

#### Step 3: Submit the Registration Transaction
Phase 1 stakers need to submit a registration transaction to the Babylon Genesis chain. 
Follow the instructions below to submit your registration transaction in the Babylon BTC
Staking Dashboard:

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/1.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/1_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- This registration transaction requires a small amount of BABY as a transaction fee.
- The transaction must include the binding of BTC and BABY addresses to activate staking and requires the staker's signature as consent for penalty security.

#### Step 4: Wait for Verification
After submitting the registration transaction, please wait patiently for it to be verified by Babylon Genesis.
<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/2.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/2_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**Once registered successfully:**
<ThemedImage
  alt="Babylon Staking Web App"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/3.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/3_dark.png'),
  }}
/>
- Your staking transaction is successfully registered on the Babylon Genesis.
- From this point forward, your stake will be subject to penalties, with a penalty rate of 0.1%.

## 2. For New Stakers
### How to Register BTC Staking in Phase 2

#### **Step 1: Connect Your BTC and BABY Wallets**

Access the [Babylon Staking Dashboard](https://btcstaking.babylonlabs.io/) and connect your BTC and 
BABY wallets.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Babylon Staking Web App"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/4.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/4_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

#### **Step 2: Choose a Finality Provider**

Select the Finality Provider to whom you want to delegate voting rights, enter your staking 
amount, and click "Preview".

<ThemedImage
  alt="Babylon Staking Web App"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/5.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/5_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Babylon Staking Web App"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/6.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/6_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Please note that different Finality Providers charge varying commission rates; lower 
commissions mean higher staking rewards.

#### **Step 3: Agree to Penalties and Wallet Binding**

You will need to agree to the penalty terms and bind your wallet. 
The transaction will then be sent to the Bitcoin network.

<ThemedImage

    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/7.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/7_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

#### **Step 4: Wait for Transaction Confirmation**

After your staking transaction is included in the Bitcoin blockchain, you will need 
to wait for 30 blocks to finalize your staking. During this waiting period, the covenant 
committee will pre-sign the transactions as part of the slashing mechanism design.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/8.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/8_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

#### **Step 5: Send the Staking Transaction**

Once the waiting period is complete, you can click "Stake BTC" and sign the transaction 
via your BTC wallet. After you see the transaction confirmation screen, your stake 
will be active.

    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/9.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/btc_stakers/web_staking/9_dark.png'),
  }}
/>
**Note:** From this point onward, your stake will be subject to a maximum penalty rate of 0.1%.
