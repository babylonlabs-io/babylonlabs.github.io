# EOTS Manager

The EOTS daemon is responsible for managing EOTS keys, producing EOTS randomness, and
using them to produce EOTS signatures.

> âš¡ **Note:** EOTS stands for Extractable One Time Signature. You can read more about it
in
the [Babylon BTC Staking Litepaper](https://docs.babylonchain.io/assets/files/btc_staking_litepaper-32bfea0c243773f0bfac63e148387aef.pdf).
In short, the EOTS manager generates EOTS public/private randomness pairs. The
finality provider commits the public part of these pairs to Babylon for every future
block height that they intend to provide a finality signature for. If the Finality
Provider votes for two different blocks on the same height, they will have to reuse
the same private randomness which will lead to their EOTS private key being
exposed, leading to slashing. 

Once a Finality Provider double-signs, their voting power is immediately reduced
to zero, while their private key is exposed. A Finality Provider that double-signs
can never regain voting power (tombstoning). Additionally, the exposed private key
of the Finality Provider can be used to fully sign the slashing transactions of all
their stake delegations.

The EOTS manager is responsible for the following operations:

1. **EOTS Key Management:**
    - Generates [Schnorr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature) key pairs
      for a given Finality Provider using the
      [BIP-340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki)
      standard as its EOTS key pair.
    - Persists generated key pairs in the internal Cosmos keyring.
2. **Randomness Generation:**
    - Generates lists of EOTS randomness pairs based on the EOTS key, chain ID, and
      block height.
    - The randomness is deterministically generated and tied to specific parameters.
3. **Signature Generation:**
    - Signs EOTS using the private key of the finality provider and the corresponding
      secret randomness for a given chain at a specified height.
    - Signs Schnorr signatures using the private key of the Finality Provider.
