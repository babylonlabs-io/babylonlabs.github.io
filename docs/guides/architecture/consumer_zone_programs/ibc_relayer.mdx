# IBC Relayer

`/babylon-relayer`

The IBC Relayer maintains the
[IBC protocol](https://cosmos.network/ibc/) connection
between Babylon Genesis and other BSNs.
It is responsible for updating the BSN's light client
inside the Babylon Genesis ledger to enable checkpointing and
propagating checkpoint information to the Babylon smart contract
deployed within the BSN.

There are different IBC relayer implementations that can achieve
this function. Most notably:

- [Cosmos Relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer):
  A fully functional relayer written in Go.
- [Babylon Genesis Relayer](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon-relayer/):
  A wrapper of the Cosmos Relayer that can maintain a one-way IBC connection.
  It is recommended to be used when the BSN does not deploy the
  Babylon smart contract.
- [Hermes Relayer](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes):
  A fully functional relayer written in Rust.
