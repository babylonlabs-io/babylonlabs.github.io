# Babylon Contracts

`/babylon-contracts`

A [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) smart contract intended for
deployment in a BSN (or Consumer Zone).
It enables Bitcoin Checkpointing functionality without introducing
invasive changes in the codebase of the BSN.
Based on the Bitcoin Checkpointing functionality,
the BSN can make decisions based on the inclusion
of its checkpoints in the Bitcoin ledger
(e.g. execute BTC-assisted unbonding requests).
