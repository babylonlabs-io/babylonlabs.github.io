# Incentive Modules

`/babylon/x/incentive`


The incentive module acts as a reward distribution and tracking system for two key aspects:

- BTC Staking Rewards Distribution
- Finality Provider Rewards Distribution

Module functions: 

- Manages reward distribution for BTC stakers
- Records historical and current rewards for Finality Providers
- Enables reward withdrawal mechanisms
- Maintains delegation rewards

Note that this module does not take care of the reward distribution for Babylon Genesis
validators. This is handled by the `distribution` module which is standard practice for 
Cosmos SDK based chains.

## BTC Staking Rewards Distribution

In this function, the incentive module manages the distribution of rewards through:

- Tracking BTC staking gauges at specific block heights
- Managing reward gauges for BTC stakers and Finality Providers
- Handling reward withdrawal requests
- Maintaining withdrawal address configurations

## Finality Provider Rewards Management

The incentive module also manages Finality Provider commissions through:

- Tracking historical rewards per Finality Provider
- Managing current rewards and periods
- Handling delegation rewards tracking
- Processing reward distribution calculations

Note that this module requires initial state configuration at genesis, including parameters
such as BTC staking portions and reward distribution rules.

## Endpoints

The incentive module provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /babylon/incentive/params` - to query module parameters
- `GET /babylon/incentive/address/{address}/reward_gauge` - to query reward gauges for a stakeholder
- `GET /babylon/incentive/btc_staking_gauge/{height}` - to query BTC staking gauge at specific height
- `GET /babylon/incentive/delegators/{delegator_address}/withdraw_address` - to query delegator's withdrawal address
- `GET /babylon/incentive/finality_providers/{finality_provider_address}/delegators/{delegator_address}/delegation_rewards` - to query delegation rewards
