# Monitor

`/babylon/x/monitor`

The monitor module serves as a monitoring and tracking system for two key aspects
of Babylon Bitcoin Staking Protocol: 

1. Ensure the BTC Light Client's height tracking is consistent
2. Ensure the Babylon Genesis's liveness and safety

This module is particularly important because it: 

- helps track the synchronization status between Babylon Genesis and Bitcoin
- provides visibility into the checkpoint reporting process
- enables verification of checkpoint integrity and liveness using checpoint hasehes

## BTC Light Client Height Tracking

In this function, the monitor module will track the Bitcoin Light Client's height
at specific epoch boundaries. Monitor when epochs end and records the corresponding
BTC block height. It will also allow querying of the historical BTC block height for
any given epoch. 

## Babylon Genesis' Liveness and Safety

The monitor module also ensures the Babylon Genesis's liveness and safety.

In this function, the monitor module will track when checkpoint are reported back to 
Babylon Genesis. Records the BTC Light Client's height at which a  specific checkpointing
were reported. It will also allow querying of checkpoint reporting using checpoint hashes. 

Note that this module does not any initial state at genesis but rather accumulates data as 
the Babylon Genesis runs. 

## Endpoints

The monitor module provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /btc/lightclient/epochs/{epoch_num}` - to query the BTC Light Client's height at a specific epoch
- `GET /btc/lightclient/checkpoints/{ckpt_hash}` - to query the checkpoint reporting history using checkpoint hashes
