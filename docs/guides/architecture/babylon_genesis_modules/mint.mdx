# Mint Module

`/babylon/x/mint`

The mint module is responsible for managing the Babylon Genesis's token supply and inflation.
It controls the minting of new tokens based on pre-defined infaltion schedules. 

This module has a few key functions in implementing economic policies: 

- Token supply management and inflation control
- Network security and economic stability

The module is important because it:

- controls network-wide token emission and inflation
- provides sustanable rewards for validators and stakers
- enable monetary policy flexibility via governance processes

The module is the key to long-term economic sustainability of the network.

## Token Supply Management

The mint module manages network's token supply via: 
- calculate new token issurance based on inflation rate
- Tracking annual provisions to maintain target inflation rate
- Adjust token supply based on network parameters
- Manage bond denomination of minted tokens

Note that this module requires initial state configuration at genesis, including bond 
denomination and minting parameters.

## State Management

The mint module maintains the following state variables: 

- `inflation_rate`: current inflation rate (e.g. 10% per year)
- `annual_provisions`: current annual token provision to be minted
- `pre_vious_block_time`: timestamp of the last block
- `bond_denom`: denomination of toekns. A genesis state of determins the initial 
denomination for miniting.

## Endpoints

The mint module exposes the following endpoint: 

- `GET /cosmos/mint/v1beta1/inflation_rate` - to query current inflation rate
- `GET /cosmos/mint/v1beta1/annual_provisions` - to query current annual token provisions
- `GET /cosmos/mint/v1beta1/genesis_time` - to query chain's genesis timestamp
