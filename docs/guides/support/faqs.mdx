## Questions about Babylon's Native Bitcoin Staking

### Will my Bitcoins be bridged or pegged to other blockchains?

**No**.
Babylon allows Bitcoin holders to stake their
bitcoins without bridging them to other blockchains,
while providing the chain with full slashable security guarantees.

### As a bitcoin staker, do I have to run a validator by myself?

**No**. Like most PoS systems,
with the Bitcoin staking protocol,
you can delegate your voting power to a validator that you trust.
The validator will usually charge a commission on your staking reward.
If the delegated validator acts maliciously, your stake will also be slashed.
Running a validator by yourself will avoid this trust and commission,
putting both the stake and reward fully under your control.

### When slashing happens, will all my staked bitcoins be burned?

**Not necessarily**.
Our protocol supports partial slashing.
This means that, when slashing happens,
only a certain portion of the staked bitcoins will be slashed,
with the portion being a parameter of the protocol.
