# Babylon Genesis Validators

Babylon Genesis follows the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus protocol. 

In Phase 2, Babylon accepts CometBFT Validators to join the network. 
The upper bound of active Validators is 100. However, there is no limit 
on the total number of Validators.

## Prerequisites

- A synced Bitcoin full node
- At least 1 tBABY in your wallet for Phase 2 Testnet and 1 BABY for Mainnet
- A system that satisfies the system requirements
for validator nodes

Anyone can join the Babylon Genesis network as a validator. However, you need to 
be in the top 60 in delegation to be actively participating in the consensus.

## Foundation Delegation Program

[Babylon Foundation](https://babylon.foundation) is running a delegation program to support high-quality and early 
infrastructure supporters of the Babylon Genesis chain. 

For details of the program, please refer to the [Foundation Delegation Program](https://babylonlabs.io/blog/announcing-babylon-foundation-s-delegation-program) blog page.

:::note
To help cover transaction fees and meet the minimum self-delegation requirement, foundation delegated 
validator's account will receive a small amount of BABY tokens on 8 April 2025 
to cover Initial gas fees.
:::

For future foundation delegations, please keep watching the [Babylon Foundation 
Website](https://babylon.foundation) for announcements.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Babylon Genesis node
Follow the [installation guide](/operators/babylon_validators/installation_guide) 
to install Babylon Genesis node.

### 2. Create a Validator Key
Initialize your validator key with `babylond init` will create the BABY key you 
need for consensus participation and a BLS key used in checkpointing and timestamping 
to Bitcoin blockchain.

See [3. Key Management](/operators/babylon_validators/installation_guide/#3-key-management) 
for more details.

### 3. Create a Validator
Instead of using `staking` module of Cosmos SDK, Babylon Genesis uses `checkpointing` 
module for validator registration and management. 

To create a validator, use `babylond tx checkpointing create-validator` command.

See [4. Create a Validator](/operators/babylon_validators/installation_guide/#4-create-a-validator) 
for more details.

### 4. Verify Your Validator

To verify your validator, first get your validator's operator address with 
`babylond keys show <your-key-name>` command. Then, use `babylond query 
checkpointing validator-registration-request` command to check if your validator 
registration request is in the queue.

Initially, your status will be `0 - BOND_STATUS_UNBONDED`. When active, your 
status will change to `3 - BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.

See [5. Verify Your Validator](/operators/babylon_validators/installation_guide/#5-verify-your-validator) 
for more details and rules.

## Communication

Join the `#finality-providers` channel in the `- tech-zone -` section of our 
[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/babylonglobal) for all communications.
Testnet announcements will also be made there. 

## CosmWasm Governance Proposals

The Babylon Genesis chain will initially use permissioned CosmWasm. After public 
launch on 10 April 2025, dApp developers are expected to submit governance proposals 
for either (a) deploying CosmWasm smart contracts or (b) whitelisting addresses to 
deploy such contracts. These proposals can be expedited (24-hour voting) or standard 
(72-hour voting). **It is important that all validators with voting power actively 
monitor on-chain proposals, review them (**[Governance guidelines](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/guides/governance/))**
, and participate in governance.**
