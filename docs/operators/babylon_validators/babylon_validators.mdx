# Babylon Genesis Validators

Babylon Genesis follows the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus protocol. 

In Phase 2, Babylon accepts CometBFT Validators to join the network. 
The upper bound of active Validators is 100. However, there is no limit 
on the total number of Validators.

## Prerequisites

- A synced Bitcoin full node
- At least 1 tBABY in your wallet for Phase 2 Testnet and 1 BABY for Mainnet
- A system that satisfies the system requirements
for validator nodes

Anyone can join the Babylon Genesis network as a validator. However, you need to 
be in the top 60 in delegation to be actively participating in the consensus.

## Foundation Delegation Program

[Babylon Foundation](https://babylon.foundation) is running a delegation program to support high-quality and early 
infrastructure supporters of the Babylon Genesis chain. 

For details of the program, please refer to the [Foundation Delegation Program](https://babylonlabs.io/blog/announcing-babylon-foundation-s-delegation-program) blog page.

:::note
To help cover transaction fees and meet the minimum self-delegation requirement, foundation delegated 
validator's account will receive a small amount of BABY tokens on 8 April 2025 
to cover Initial gas fees.
:::

For future foundation delegations, please keep watching the [Babylon Foundation 
Website](https://babylon.foundation) for announcements.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Babylon Genesis node
Follow the [installation guide](/operators/babylon_validators/installation_guide) 
to install Babylon Genesis node.

### 2. Create a Validator Key
Initialize your validator key with `babylond init` will create the BABY key you 
need for consensus participation and a BLS key used in checkpointing and timestamping 
to Bitcoin blockchain.

### 3. Create a Validator
Instead of using `staking` module of Cosmos SDK, Babylon Genesis uses `checkpointing` 
module for validator registration and management. 

To create a validator, use `babylond tx checkpointing create-validator` command.

### 4. Verify Your Validator

To verify your validator, first get your validator's operator address with 
`babylond keys show <your-key-name>` command. Then, use `babylond query 
checkpointing validator-registration-request` command to check if your validator 
registration request is in the queue.

Initially, your status will be `0 - BOND_STATUS_UNBONDED`. When active, your 
status will change to `3 - BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.
