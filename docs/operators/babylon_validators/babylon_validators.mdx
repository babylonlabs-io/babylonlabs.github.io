# Babylon Genesis Validators

Babylon Genesis follows the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus protocol. 

In Phase 2 Testnet, Babylon accepts chain Validators to join the network. 
The upper bound of active Validators is 100. However there is no limit 
on the total number of Validators.

## Prerequisites

- A synced Bitcoin full node
- At least 1.0 tBABY in your wallet for Phase 2 Testnet
- A system that satisfies the system requirements
for validator nodes

## Faucets 

There are two ways to get tBABY for Phase 2 Testnet:

1. [Babylon Labs Discord Faucet](https://discord.com/channels/1266159481218457600/1266159481218457600)
2. Request it from a Babylon Labs supporting staff or message us on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1046686458070700112/1282600119346270281n). 

More faucets will be added in the future.
