# IBC Relayer Setup Guide

Babylon uses IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol) to enable cross-chain communication.
To support this capability it relies on relayers, processes that can be run by anyone which constantly scan for outbound packets on one chain and submits these packets alongside corresponding proofs on the destination chain.
This section describes how one can setup a relayer and create new connections between chains.

There are two standard implementations:

- Hermes built in Rust
- Go Relayer built in Go

The following guide explains how to establish IBC connections and relay packets between Celestia Mocha testnet and Babylon testnet networks by using the Hermes relayer.

## Hermes
Hermes is an open-source Rust implementation of an IBC relayer released as part of the ibc-relayer-cli crate.
It includes a CLI for relaying packets between Cosmos SDK chains, as well as Prometheus metrics and a REST API.

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)

Please follow the steps at [Hermes Quick Start](https://hermes.informal.systems/quick-start/) to install Hermes.
Before proceeding, verify that Hermes is installed correctly by running `hermes version`.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites
- **Funded** Celestia Mocha account
- **Funded** Babylon testnet account

To acquire testnet tokens for Celestia Mocha, use [Celestia Testnet Faucet bot](https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity).
To get testnet tokens for Babylon testnet, use [Babylon Genesis Testnet Faucet](https://babylon-explorer.xangle.io/testnet/faucet).

### Configure the chains

After installing Hermes, create `.hermes` folder in your `$HOME` directory and create a config file.

```bash
mkdir $HOME/.hermes
```

Copy `config.toml` file from the `hermes` repository to the `.hermes` folder.

```bash
cp $HOME/hermes/config.toml $HOME/.hermes/config.toml
```

For this tutorial, we will be using the following chains:

- Celestia's mocha-4 testnet
- Babylon's Phase 2 testnet








Edit the Hermes configuration.

```bash
vim $HOME/.hermes/config.toml
```

```toml

### Create/Add relayer wallets

Now that we have successfully configured our relaying chains, we need to import the wallets that will be used for relaying. Please note that both wallets need to be funded with the native tokens of each chain.

You can use Keplr to create a wallet for Celestia Mocha and Babylon testnet.
You can get testnet tokens from faucets for bot testnets via Discord:
Celestia: https://discord.gg/celestiacommunity
Cosmos Hub: https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork

Add your seed phrase to a `.mnemonic` file and upload it to the server. Do not use wallets for anything else but relaying to avoid running into account sequence errors.

Follow the steps at [Adding Keys to Hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/quick-start/adding-keys-to-hermes/) to add keys for each chain:

```bash
hermes keys add --chain bbn-test-6 --mnemonic-file <PATH_TO_MNEMONIC_FILE>

hermes keys add --chain mocha-4 --mnemonic-file <PATH_TO_MNEMONIC_FILE>
```
### Verify configuration files
After editing config.toml and adding wallet keys, run the health check:

```bash
hermes health-check
hermes config validate
```
If everything was set up correctly, you should see output like:

```bash
SUCCESS performed health check for all chains in the config
SUCCESS "configuration is valid"
```

### Create clients

First, verify that the chains do not have existing clients:

```bash
hermes query clients --host-chain mocha-4 --reference-chain bbn-test-6
```
To create a new client, use the [`create-client`](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/commands/path-setup/clients.html#create-client) command:

```bash
hermes create client --host-chain mocha-4 --reference-chain bbn-test-6
```

You should see output like:

```bash
SUCCESS CreateClient(
    CreateClient(
        Attributes {
            client_id: ClientId(
                "07-tendermint-27",
            ),
            client_type: Tendermint,
            consensus_height: Height {
                revision: 4,
                height: 5730919,
            },
        },
    ),
)
```
:::note
Make sure that accounts on both chains are funded with the native tokens of each chain.
Otherwise, you will get an error:

```bash
ERROR foreign client error: error raised while creating client for chain mocha-4
```
:::

Create a second client:

```bash
hermes create client --host-chain bbn-test-6 --reference-chain mocha-4
```

### Create a connection

To create a connection between the two clients run:

```bash
hermes create connection --host-chain mocha-4 --reference-chain bbn-test-6
```

You should see output like:

```bash
SUCCESS Connection {
    delay_period: 0ns,
    a_side: ConnectionSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "mocha-4",
                version: 4,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-595",
        ),
        connection_id: Some(
            ConnectionId(
                "connection-654",
            ),
        ),
    },
    b_side: ConnectionSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "bbn-test-6",
                version: 6,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-29",
        ),
        connection_id: Some(
            ConnectionId(
                "connection-27",
            ),
        ),
    },
}
```
Now that the connection has been established over the clients, we need to create a new channel using an existing connection:

```bash
hermes create channel --a-chain mocha-4 --a-connection connection-654 --a-port transfer --b-port transfer
```

You should see output like:

```bash
SUCCESS Channel {
    ordering: Unordered,
    a_side: ChannelSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "mocha-4",
                version: 4,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-595",
        ),
        connection_id: ConnectionId(
            "connection-654",
        ),
        port_id: PortId(
            "transfer",
        ),
        channel_id: Some(
            ChannelId(
                "channel-389",
            ),
        ),
        version: None,
    },
    b_side: ChannelSide {
        chain: BaseChainHandle {
            chain_id: ChainId {
                id: "bbn-test-6",
                version: 6,
            },
            runtime_sender: Sender { .. },
        },
        client_id: ClientId(
            "07-tendermint-29",
        ),
        connection_id: ConnectionId(
            "connection-27",
        ),
        port_id: PortId(
            "transfer",
        ),
        channel_id: Some(
            ChannelId(
                "channel-20",
            ),
        ),
        version: None,
    },
    connection_delay: 0ns,
```
### Configure channels in Hermes
Now that we have created new connections and opened channels, we need to edit config.toml again and add the newly created channels, or use the already existing ones.

For mocha-4 add:

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = "allow"
list = [["transfer", "channel-389"]]
```

For bbn-test-6 add:

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = "allow"
list = [["transfer","channel-20"]]
```

### Start the relayer
Start the relayer via hermes start

```bash
hermes start
```
