## Best Practices

:::tip Effective Help Usage
- **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with general help, then drill down to specific commands
- **Use help before searching documentation** - Often faster than web searches
- **Combine with --dry-run** - Use help to understand, then test with dry-run
- **Save useful help output** - Create personal reference files for complex commands
:::

:::info Learning Strategy
- **Explore systematically** - Go through each major command group
- **Focus on your use case** - Prioritize commands relevant to your role
- **Practice with examples** - Try the examples shown in help output
- **Build incrementally** - Start with simple commands, add complexity gradually
:::

:::note Documentation Hierarchy
- **Help command** - Quick syntax and flag reference
- **Official documentation** - Comprehensive guides and explanations
- **Community resources** - Tutorials and real-world examples
- **Source code** - Ultimate truth for complex behaviors

## Help Integration with Workflows

### Development Workflow

```bash title="Help-driven development"
#!/bin/bash
# Use help to build scripts correctly

# 1. Research the command
babylond help tx bank send

# 2. Understand required parameters
# from_key_or_address, to_address, amount

# 3. Check available flags
# --chain-id, --gas, --fees, etc.

# 4. Build the command
babylond tx bank send \
  alice \
  babylon1recipient... \
  1000ubbn \
  --chain-id babylon-1 \
  --gas auto \
  --yes

echo "‚úÖ Command built using help guidance"
```

### Troubleshooting Workflow

```bash title="Help for troubleshooting"
# When a command fails, check help for correct syntax
if ! babylond tx checkpointing create-validator ...; then
    echo "‚ùå Command failed, checking help..."
    babylond help tx checkpointing create-validator
    echo "Review the syntax and try again"
fi
```

### Learning New Features

```bash title="Systematic feature exploration"
# Explore new modules or features
NEW_MODULE="btcstaking"

echo "üìö Exploring $NEW_MODULE module..."
babylond help tx $NEW_MODULE
babylond help query $NEW_MODULE

# Try each subcommand help
for cmd in $(babylond help tx $NEW_MODULE | grep -E "^  [a-z]" | awk '{print $1}'); do
    echo "Learning: tx $NEW_MODULE $cmd"
    babylond help tx $NEW_MODULE $cmd
done
```

## Common Help Patterns

### Finding the Right Command

```bash title="Command discovery patterns"
# Looking for specific functionality
babylond help | grep -i "validator"    # Find validator-related commands
babylond help | grep -i "stake"        # Find staking commands
babylond help | grep -i "key"          # Find key management commands

# Exploring transaction types
babylond help tx | grep -i "bank"      # Banking transactions
babylond help tx | grep -i "gov"       # Governance transactions
babylond help tx | grep -i "btc"       # BTC-related transactions
```

### Understanding Flag Usage

```bash title="Flag exploration"
# Common flags across commands
babylond help start | grep -A5 "Flags:"
babylond help tx | grep -A10 "Global Flags:"

# Understanding gas and fee flags
babylond help tx bank send | grep -E "(gas|fee)"

# Finding output format options
babylond help query | grep -E "(output|format)"
```
