### FAQs

#### Q: How can I retrieve the correct genesis file?
**A:**
You can download the genesis file from
[Babylon Labs' networks repository](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/networks/blob/main/bbn-test-5/network-artifacts/genesis.json).
Ensure you're using the correct version of the Babylon binary specified in the documentation.

#### Q: What are the hardware requirements for running Babylon nodes and a Finality Provider?
**A:**
An instance with at least 8 GB of RAM should be sufficient to host both a
Babylon node and a Finality Provider. However, for better reliability, it is recommended
to run them on separate instances.

#### Q: How do I set up my Babylon Validator?
**A:**
Follow these steps:
1. **Install the Babylon Binary**
   - Download and install the necessary Babylon binary (`babylond`). Ensure you obtain it from the official and reliable sources provided by the Babylon project. This binary serves as the core tool for interacting with the Babylon network as a validator.
2. **Initialize Your Node**
   - Run the command `babylond init`. During this process, you'll need to provide a unique moniker for your validator node. This moniker will help identify your node within the network.
   For example: ``` language="bash">babylond init "YourUniqueValidatorMoniker" --chain - id <your - chain - id>```, where `<your - chain - id>` corresponds to the specific chain ID of the Babylon network you're participating in (such as `bbn - test - 5` for the testnet).
3. **Sync Your Node**
   - **Using Genesis File**
     - Download the official genesis file from the Babylon project's official repository or the designated location for your network version. Place the `genesis.json` file in the appropriate directory (usually `~/.babylond/config` if you haven't customized the `--home` flag). This file contains the initial state of the network, which your node needs to sync with.
   - **Using a Snapshot**
     - If available, using a snapshot can significantly speed up the sync process. Follow the instructions provided by the Babylon community or the official documentation to correctly apply the snapshot to your node. Snapshots are pre - synchronized data that can quickly bring your node up - to - date with the network state.
4. **Configure `config.toml` and Add Persistent Peers**
   - Locate the `config.toml` file in your node's configuration directory. In this file, you can configure various settings related to your node, such as network - related parameters, listening addresses, and port numbers.
   - One crucial step is adding persistent peers. Persistent peers are other nodes in the network that your node will maintain connections with to stay updated and participate in the consensus process. You can find a list of reliable persistent peers in the official Babylon documentation or through community channels. Add these peers to the appropriate section in the `config.toml` file following the specified format.
5. **Register Your Validator**
   - Create a `validator.json` file that contains detailed information about your validator. The file should include the following key - value pairs:
     - `"pubkey"` (required): The public key of your validator. You can obtain this key through the key generation process, such as using `babylond create - bls - key` (for BLS - based validators).
     - `"amount"` (required): The amount of tokens (e.g., `ubbn`) you intend to stake as self - delegation. Make sure the amount is specified correctly according to the network's token denomination.
     - `"commission_rate"` (required): The commission rate you will charge for your validation services. This rate determines the percentage of rewards you will receive from the staked tokens.
     - `"moniker"` (required): The same moniker you used during the `babylond init` step. It helps in identifying your validator within the network.
     - Optional fields may include `"identity"` (e.g., your Keybase or UPort identity), `"website"` (your validator's website), `"security_contact"` (your security contact email), etc.
   - Here is an example structure of the `validator.json` file:
```
{
    "pubkey": "YOUR_VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY",
    "amount": "1000000ubbn",
    "commission_rate": "0.07",
    "moniker": "YourUniqueValidatorMoniker",
    "identity": "",
    "website": "",
    "security_contact": ""
}
```
   - Once the `validator.json` file is created, register your validator using the command:
   ``` language="bash">babylond tx checkpointing create - validator [path/to/validator.json] [flags]```.
   Replace `[path/to/validator.json]` with the actual path to the `validator.json` file you created. The `[flags]` may include options such as `--chain - id` to specify the network chain ID, `--from` to indicate the wallet from which you'll sign the transaction (ensure this wallet has enough tokens to cover staking and transaction fees), `--gas` to set the gas limit for the transaction (you can use `auto` to let the system calculate it), `--gas - adjustment` to adjust the calculated gas amount, and `--fees` to specify the transaction fees you're willing to pay.

For more in - depth and detailed information, including specific parameter values, troubleshooting tips, and security best practices, please refer to the [official setup guide](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/networks/blob/main/bbn-test-5/babylon-node/README.md). This guide is regularly updated to reflect the latest changes and requirements of the Babylon network, ensuring you have the most accurate and useful information for setting up your validator successfully.

## Finality Providers

### Recommendations

**Connection Suggestions**
   - Do not use multiple nodes behind a load balancer.
   - Always connect to a single, trusted Babylon RPC node.
   - Enable transaction indexing on your RPC node.

**Voting Mechanism Suggestions**
   - The jailing mechanism is similar to Cosmos SDK's native approach, Babylon
Genesis is built with the Cosmos SDK and uses the [x/slashing module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/slashing).
   - It is designed to protect network integrity and prevent malicious activities.

### Q&A

#### Q: How do I register my Finality Provider (FP)?
**A:**
Check and run following steps:
- Ensure you have an existing EOTS key from previous testnets.
- Run `fpd keys add` to create a Babylon key.
- Use `fpd create-finality-provider` to register your FP.
- Ensure `fpd start --eots-pk <your-eots-pk>` is running.
- Verify your FP status on an explorer or with `babylond q finality`.

#### Q: How do I check if my Finality Provider is active?
**A:**
Run:
```bash
babylond q finality provider <your-provider-address>
```
Your provider should have an active status and be voting on finality.

#### Q: What are the key recommendations for running a Finality Provider daemon?
**A:**

Follow these critical guidelines:
- Connect your Finality Provider daemon to a trusted Babylon RPC node.
- Ensure you're connected to a single Babylon node (avoid load balancers).
- Verify that your RPC node has transaction indexing enabled.

#### Q: How can I prevent duplicate finality votes?
**A:**
Try the following:
- Use a single, dedicated Babylon RPC node with transaction indexing enabled.
- Monitor your daemon's connection and status regularly.
- Check logs for any duplicate vote warnings.

#### Q: What should I do if my Finality Provider is jailed?
**A:**
Follow these steps:
- Immediately check the status using `fpd finality-provider-info [eots-pk-hex]`.
- Verify your daemon's status on the Babylon staking dashboard.
- Investigate and resolve the underlying issue causing the jailing.
- Follow the official Babylon unjailing guide to restore your provider's status.

#### Q: What are the key recommendations for running a Finality Provider daemon?
**A:**
Follow these critical guidelines:
- Connect your Finality Provider daemon to a trusted Babylon RPC node.
- Ensure you're connected to a single Babylon node (avoid load balancers).
- Verify that your RPC node has transaction indexing enabled.

#### Q: My EOTS daemon is not working correctly. What should I do?
**A:**
Check if your eotsd is returning the following logs:
```bash
[eotsd] failed to create db backend: timeout
```
If you see this log, it means that your EOTS daemon is not working correctly due to
BD lock. Try to remove the process causing the lock on .bd file and restart.

#### Q: How do I reset my EOTS daemon configuration?
**A:**
If there is something wrong with your current config and the following error pops up:
Run:
```bash
[eotsd] failed to load config at...
```
This is probably due to a new parameter appeared in the config and you could create a
new default config with `eotsd init`, just remember to update the values to your key name and directory path
