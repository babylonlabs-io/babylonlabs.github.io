# Operator Frequently Asked Questions

## Babylon Genesis Validators

## Recommendations

- Regularly monitor your node's status.
- Keep your node software and configurations up to date.
- Maintain secure and reliable deployment infrastructure.
- Participate in community channels for the latest updates and changes.

### FAQs

#### Q: How can I retrieve the correct genesis file?
**A:**
You can download the genesis file from
[Babylon Labs' networks repository](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/networks/blob/main/bbn-test-5/network-artifacts/genesis.json).
Ensure you're using the correct version of the Babylon binary specified in the documentation.

#### Q: What are the hardware requirements for running Babylon nodes and a Finality Provider?
**A:**
An instance with at least 8 GB of RAM should be sufficient to host both a
Babylon node and a Finality Provider. However, for better reliability, it is recommended
to run them on separate instances.

#### Q: How do I set up my Babylon Validator?
**A:**
Follow these steps:
- Install the required Babylon binary.
- Initialize your node with `babylond init`.
- Sync from the correct genesis file or a snapshot.
- Configure `config.toml` and add persistent peers.
- Register your Validator with `babylond tx staking create-validator`.
Refer to the [official setup guide](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/networks/blob/main/bbn-test-5/babylon-node/README.md)
for details.

#### Q: What ports should I open for my Babylon node?
**A:**
Open the following ports:
- **RPC Port:** 26657
- **gRPC Port:** 9090
- **P2P Port:** 26656
Ensure proper firewall rules if your Validator and Finality Provider are on different instances.

#### Q: How can I check my Validatorâ€™s status?
**A:**
Use:
```bash
babylond q staking validator <your-valoper-address>
```
Alternatively, check your status on an explorer such as [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/babylon-testnet/validators)
or [Node Guru](https://testnet.babylon.explorers.guru/).

#### Q: How do I upgrade my Babylon Validator node?
**A:**
Try the following:
- Stop your node.
- Download and install the latest binary.
- Restart your node with the updated version.
- Ensure proper synchronization by checking logs.

#### Q: How do I recover from a failed upgrade?
**A:**

If your node fails to start after an upgrade:
- Check logs for error messages.
- Ensure you're using the correct genesis file or state snapshot.
- Run `unsafe-reset-all` and resync the node.
- If necessary, reinitialize the Validator and restore from a backup.


#### Q: What should I do if my Validator is jailed?
**A:**
Try the following:
- Check logs for issues related to missed votes or incorrect configurations.
- Run `babylond tx slashing unjail` to attempt unjailing.
- Ensure your Validator is active and signing correctly before attempting unjailing.

#### Q: How do I stake and delegate tokens to a Validator?
**A:**
Use the following command:
```bash
babylond tx staking delegate <validator-address> <amount>ubbn --from <your-wallet>
```
Ensure your wallet has sufficient balance to cover transaction fees.


#### Q: How do I withdraw Validator rewards?
**A:**
Use the following command:
```bash
babylond tx distribution withdraw-rewards <your-valoper-address> --from <your-wallet>
```
Add `--commission` if you want to withdraw Validator commission as well.

#### Q: How do I redelegate my stake to another Validator?
**A:**
Use:
```bash
babylond tx staking redelegate <src-validator> <dest-validator> <amount>ubbn --from <your-wallet>
```
Wait for the redelegation cooldown period before performing another redelegation.

#### Q: What should I do if my node stops syncing?
**A:**
Try the following:
- Restart your node and check logs for errors.
- Verify that your peers and seeds are correctly set in `config.toml`.
- If necessary, resync from a trusted snapshot.

#### Q: What precautions should I take when resetting my node?
**A:**
Read the following:
- **CAUTION:** Avoid using `unsafe-reset-all` without proper preparation.
- This command may remove BLS keys stored in `priv_validator_key.json`.
- Always create a backup of `priv_validator_key.json` before any reset.
- Wait for future updates that will separate BLS keys for improved safety.

#### Q: How can I safely reset my Babylon node?
**A:**
Try the following:
- Create a full backup of all critical configuration files.
- Specifically, backup `priv_validator_key.json`.
- Consult the latest Babylon documentation for recommended reset procedures.
- Consider reaching out to Babylon support if you're unsure about the reset process.


## Finality Providers

### Recommendations

**Connection Suggestions**
   - Do not use multiple nodes behind a load balancer.
   - Always connect to a single, trusted Babylon RPC node.
   - Enable transaction indexing on your RPC node.

**Voting Mechanism Suggestions**
   - The jailing mechanism is similar to Cosmos SDK's native approach, Babylon
Genesis is built with the Cosmos SDK and uses the [x/slashing module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/slashing).
   - It is designed to protect network integrity and prevent malicious activities.

### Q&A

#### Q: How do I register my Finality Provider (FP)?
**A:**
Check and run following steps:
- Ensure you have an existing EOTS key from previous testnets.
- Run `fpd keys add` to create a Babylon key.
- Use `fpd create-finality-provider` to register your FP.
- Ensure `fpd start --eots-pk <your-eots-pk>` is running.
- Verify your FP status on an explorer or with `babylond q finality`.

#### Q: How do I check if my Finality Provider is active?
**A:**
Run:
```bash
babylond q finality provider <your-provider-address>
```
Your provider should have an active status and be voting on finality.

#### Q: What are the key recommendations for running a Finality Provider daemon?
**A:**

Follow these critical guidelines:
- Connect your Finality Provider daemon to a trusted Babylon RPC node.
- Ensure you're connected to a single Babylon node (avoid load balancers).
- Verify that your RPC node has transaction indexing enabled.

#### Q: How can I prevent duplicate finality votes?
**A:**
Try the following:
- Use a single, dedicated Babylon RPC node with transaction indexing enabled.
- Monitor your daemon's connection and status regularly.
- Check logs for any duplicate vote warnings.

#### Q: What should I do if my Finality Provider is jailed?
**A:**
Follow these steps:
- Immediately check the status using `fpd finality-provider-info [eots-pk-hex]`.
- Verify your daemon's status on the Babylon staking dashboard.
- Investigate and resolve the underlying issue causing the jailing.
- Follow the official Babylon unjailing guide to restore your provider's status.

#### Q: What are the key recommendations for running a Finality Provider daemon?
**A:**
Follow these critical guidelines:
- Connect your Finality Provider daemon to a trusted Babylon RPC node.
- Ensure you're connected to a single Babylon node (avoid load balancers).
- Verify that your RPC node has transaction indexing enabled.

#### Q: My EOTS daemon is not working correctly. What should I do?
**A:**
Check if your eotsd is returning the following logs:
```bash
[eotsd] failed to create db backend: timeout
```
If you see this log, it means that your EOTS daemon is not working correctly due to
BD lock. Try to remove the process causing the lock on .bd file and restart.

#### Q: How do I reset my EOTS daemon configuration?
**A:**
If there is something wrong with your current config and the following error pops up:
Run:
```bash
[eotsd] failed to load config at...
```
This is probably due to a new parameter appeared in the config and you could create a
new default config with `eotsd init`, just remember to update the values to your key name and directory path
