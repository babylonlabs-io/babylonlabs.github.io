# Phase 2 Finality Provider Registration Guide

Babylon Bitcoin Staking Network has entered its second phase of operation since 
10 April 2025. As a result, all existing finality providers will need to register 
again in Phase 2 network.

This guide provides instructions for both existing Phase 1 participants and new 
Finality Providers looking to join Phase 2 network.

## Finality Providers Participated in Phase 1

If your Finality Provider received staking in Phase 1, you will need to register 
in Phase 2 again. Failing to do so will cause your BTC delegation to not be 
recognized in Phase 2 network.

### Prerequisites
- You should have already registered your Finality Provider for [the airdrop](https://babylon.foundation/docs/link-a-finality-provider-eots-pk-to-your-baby-address)
- Your BABY account should be created and credited with tokens for gas costs
- Your EOTS key from Phase 1 (no need to create a new one)

### Registration Steps

#### 1. Register on Babylon Genesis
To register your Finality Provider during the registration period, you will need to: 
- Ensure your program is operational
- Verify interactions with the EOTS manager are healthy
- Use the command: `fpd create-finality-provider` to create a registration request.
  For detailed instructions, see [Create Finality Provider](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/operators/finality_providers/fp_operations/#61-create-finality-provider) in the FP Operations Guide.
  You will need the BABY account address created earlier and your previous Phase 
  1 EOTS key.

#### 2. Ensure Healthy Finality Voting
Once registered and the finality protocol is live, if you are in the top 60 FPs, your 
Finality Provider will be active and begin submitting finality votes. 

### Important Steps for Your Stakers
Only after you have registered your Finality Provider on Phase 2, your stakers
can transfer their stake to Phase 2. Please communicate the following to your 
Phase 1 stakers:

#### Stakers Participated in Cap 1
- Can immediately transfer their stake to Phase 2 via [Babylon Staking Dashboard](https://btcstaking.babylonlabs.io/)
- Check the [Cap 1 staking transactions allowed list](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/allowed-list-cap-1)

#### Stakers Participated in Cap 2 & 3
