# Babylon Genesis Stakers Overview

Babylon Genesis implements a **dual-staking model** that combines the security of BTC 
(a PoW asset) with the efficiency of Proof-of-Stake consensus. This innovative approach 
allows both **BTC holders** and **BABY token holders** to participate in securing the network 
while earning rewards.

## Two Staking Mechanisms

### 1. Bitcoin (BTC) Staking

**BTC staking** enables Bitcoin holders to stake their assets directly on the Bitcoin network in a self-custodial manner without wrapping or bridging. BTC stakers delegate to **Finality Providers** who enhance the security of the Proof-of-Stake chain.

#### Key Features:
- **Self-custodial**: Maintain direct control of your Bitcoin
- **Native operation**: No wrapped tokens or bridges required
- **Trustless execution**: No reliance on third parties
- **Slashing capability**: Protocol-enforced penalties for malicious behavior
- **Multi-staking**: Delegate across multiple Finality Providers and BSNs

#### Benefits:
- **Earn BABY rewards**: Receive a portion of the annual inflation allocated to BTC stakers
- **Secure the network**: Contribute to Babylon Genesis chain's security
- **Maintain Bitcoin ownership**: Your BTC remains on the Bitcoin blockchain
- **Fast unbonding**: ~2 days compared to typical 21 days in most PoS chains

### 2. BABY Token Staking

**BABY staking** is a native staking mechanism that secures the Babylon Genesis chain. BABY token holders delegate to chain validators to accrue inflationary rewards proportional to their stake.

#### Key Features:
- **Epoch-based staking**: Delayed execution queue for enhanced security
- **Fast unbonding**: ~2 days via Bitcoin timestamping protocol
- **Governance participation**: Voting power in chain governance
- **Partial slashing**: 5% slashing for double-signing violations

#### Benefits:
- **Earn rewards**: Receive a portion of the annual inflation allocated to BABY stakers
- **Secure the network**: Contribute to the Babylon Genesis chain's security and decentralization
- **Governance rights**: Participate in shaping the future of the network
- **Fast unbonding**: Significantly reduced unbonding period


## How They Work Together

The dual-staking model creates a robust security framework:

### Security Model
- **BTC stakers** delegate to Finality Providers who enhance PoS security
- **BABY stakers** delegate to validators who oversee block production and consensus
- Both mechanisms contribute to securing the Babylon Genesis chain

### Reward Distribution
The annual inflation (8%) is distributed among:
- **BTC stakers**: 4% of annual inflation
- **BABY stakers**: 4% of annual inflation

### Governance
- **BABY stakers** participate in governance with voting power
- **BTC stakers** do not participate in governance but receive rewards


## Risk Considerations

### BTC Staking Risks
- **Slashing risk**: 0.1% maximum penalty for protocol violations
- **Finality Provider risk**: Choose reliable Finality Providers
- **Market volatility**: BTC price fluctuations affect staking value

### BABY Staking Risks
- **Slashing risk**: 5% penalty for validator double-signing
- **Validator risk**: Choose reliable validators with good track records
- **Market volatility**: BABY price fluctuations affect staking value

## Advanced Features

### Fast Unbonding
Both BTC and BABY staking benefit from Babylon's Bitcoin Timestamping protocol:
- **~2 days unbonding** vs typical 21 days
- **Bitcoin checkpoint verification** ensures security
- **Automatic token release** once confirmations are met

### Multi-Staking (BTC)
BTC stakers can delegate across multiple Finality Providers and BSNs simultaneously:
- **Diversify risk** across multiple networks
- **Maximize rewards** from multiple sources
- **Maintain security isolation** between networks

This dual-staking model represents the foundation of Babylon's Bitcoin Secured Network, 
combining the robustness of Bitcoin with the efficiency of Proof of Stake consensus to 
create a secure, decentralized, and rewarding staking ecosystem.
