## What is Co-Staking?

Co-staking allows you to earn **extra rewards** by staking both Bitcoin (BTC) and BABY tokens simultaneously. The more BABY you stake alongside your BTC, the more co-staking rewards you'll receive.

**Key Benefits:**
- Earn additional 2.35% annual inflation rewards on top of regular BTC and BABY staking rewards
- Maximize your returns by participating in both validation and finality provision
- Support the Babylon network's security while earning more

## Step-by-Step Guide to Co-Staking

### The Simple Flow

Co-staking requires two simple steps that must use the **same BABY address**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 1: BTC → Finality Provider → ACTIVE                   │
│  ┌──────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌────────┐             │
│  │ BTC  │ ───> │ Finality     │ ───> │ ACTIVE │             │
│  │      │      │ Provider     │      │        │             │
│  └──────┘      └──────────────┘      └────────┘             │
│                                                             │
│  Step 2: BABY → Validator → ACTIVE                          │
│  ┌──────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌────────┐                 │
│  │ BABY │ ───> │ Validator│ ───> │ ACTIVE │                 │
│  │      │      │          │      │        │                 │
│  └──────┘      └──────────┘      └────────┘                 │
│                                                             │
│  ⚠️  CRITICAL: Both must use the SAME BABY address!         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

:::tip ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING
**Wrong Address = Zero Co-Staking Rewards!**

If your BTC staking address and BABY staking address are different, you will receive **ZERO co-staking rewards**. Always ensure both delegations use the exact same BABY address.

### Step 1: Stake Bitcoin (BTC)

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
- Open the [Babylon dashboard](https://staking.babylonlabs.io/)
- Click "Connect Wallet" and select your wallet (Keplr, Cosmostation, etc.)

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard Connect Wallet"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/dashboard.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/dashboard_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<br />
- Make sure you're connected to the Babylon network
- **⚠️ Remember the BABY address you're using - you'll need the same address for Step 2!**

2. **Choose a Finality Provider**
- Navigate to the BTC Staking section

<ThemedImage
  alt="BTC-Staking Section"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/btc_staking.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/btc_staking_dark.png'),
  }}
/>


- Select an active Finality Provider from the available list

<ThemedImage
  alt="Choose Finality Provider"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/choose_fp.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/choose_fp_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Consider factors like commission rate, uptime, and reputation

3. **Create a BTC Delegation**
- Specify the amount of BTC you want to stake

<ThemedImage
  alt="Enter BTC Amount"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/enter_btc_amount.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/enter_btc_amount_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Preview BTC Staking"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/preview.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/preview_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Complete the EOI (Expression of Interest) process

<ThemedImage
  alt="EOI Process"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/eoi.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/eoi_dark.png'),

<ThemedImage
  alt="Activity Status"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/activity.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/activity_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Monitor the status in the dashboard
- Once `ACTIVE`, your BTC is providing security to the network and earning rewards

---

### Step 2: Stake BABY Tokens

Next, stake BABY tokens to CometBFT validators using the **SAME BABY address** as Step 1.

1. **Ensure Same Wallet Connection**
- Make sure you're still connected with the same wallet from Step 1
- Verify the BABY address matches the one used for BTC staking
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: The address must be EXACTLY the same!**

2. **Choose a Validator**
- Navigate to the BABY Staking section in the dashboard

<ThemedImage
  alt="BABY Staking Section"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/baby_staking.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/baby_staking_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Select a CometBFT validator from the validator list

<ThemedImage
  alt="Validator Selection"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/validators.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/validators_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Consider commission rate, performance, and uptime

3. **Delegate BABY Tokens**
- Enter the amount of BABY you want to stake

<ThemedImage
  alt="Enter BABY Amount"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/enter_baby_amount.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/enter_baby_amount_dark.png'),
  }}
/>
- Click "Preview"

<ThemedImage
  alt="BABY Staking Preview"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/baby_preview.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/baby_preview_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Review and confirm the delegation transaction

<ThemedImage
  alt="Review and Confirm"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/review_confirm.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/review_confirm_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

4. **Verify Your Delegation**
- Check that your BABY delegation is active in the dashboard

<ThemedImage
  alt="Review and Confirm"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/baby_activity.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/baby_activity_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Step 3: Understand Co-Staking Rewards

Co-staking rewards are calculated based on a **weighted formula** that considers both your BTC and BABY stakes.

#### The Formula

For each co-staker, the weight is calculated as:

```
w = min(B_BABY / R, B_BTC)
```

Where:
- `B_BABY` = Amount of BABY you have staked
- `B_BTC` = Amount of BTC you have staked to active FPs
- `R` = Co-staking factor = 20,000

This means: **Every 20,000 BABY staked makes 1 BTC eligible for co-staking rewards.**

**Important:** The weight can be any decimal value - you don't need at least 1 BTC or 20,000 BABY to earn rewards! Even small amounts will earn proportional rewards.

#### Optimal Ratio Visualization

The best ratio for maximizing co-staking rewards is **20,000 BABY per 1 BTC**:

| BTC Staked | Optimal BABY | Co-Staking Weight | Efficiency |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0.1 BTC | 2,000 BABY | 0.1 BTC-equivalent | 100% ✅ |
| 0.5 BTC | 10,000 BABY | 0.5 BTC-equivalent | 100% ✅ |
| 1 BTC | 20,000 BABY | 1 BTC-equivalent | 100% ✅ |
| 1 BTC | 10,000 BABY | 0.5 BTC-equivalent | 50% ⚠️ |
| 1 BTC | 40,000 BABY | 1 BTC-equivalent | 100% ✅ (excess BABY) |
| 6 BTC | 120,000 BABY | 6 BTC-equivalent | 100% ✅ |

#### Reward Distribution

Your co-staking reward is calculated as:

```
Your Reward = Total Co-Staking Pool × (Your Weight / Total Weight of All Co-Stakers)
```

The total co-staking pool is **2.35% of annual inflation**.

### Step 4: Monitor Your Rewards

1. **Check Your Co-Staking Status**
- Verify that both your BTC and BABY stakes are active

2. **Calculate Your Expected Rewards**
- 👉 **[Use the Co-Staking Calculator](#co-staking-reward-calculator-1)** to estimate your rewards
- Remember: rewards depend on total network participation

3. **Withdraw Rewards**

**✅ One-Click Withdrawal!** Co-staking rewards are automatically included when you withdraw BTC staking rewards.

**Easiest way: Click the "Rewards" button in the dashboard!**

<ThemedImage
  alt="Review and Confirm"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/rewards.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/guides/co-staking/rewards_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- **Automatically withdraws**:
- ✅ BTC staking rewards
- ✅ Co-staking rewards
- One click to claim all related rewards!


## Important Notes

### Requirements

✅ **Must have active BTC delegations** to Finality Providers<br/>
✅ **Must have active BABY delegations** to CometBFT validators<br/>
✅ **Must use the same BABY address** for both BTC and BABY staking<br/>
✅ **BTC delegations must be ACTIVE** (not just VERIFIED)

### Limitations

⚠️ **Commission cannot be charged** on co-staking rewards due to Cosmos SDK limitations<br/>
⚠️ **Rewards are proportional** - more co-stakers means smaller individual rewards<br/>
⚠️ **Optimal ratio** - You need 20,000 BABY per BTC to maximize rewards

### Common Misconceptions

❌ **Myth:** "I need at least 1 BTC or 20,000 BABY to earn co-staking rewards"<br/>
✅ **Reality:** Any amount of BTC and BABY will earn rewards proportionally.<br/> For example:
- 0.1 BTC + 1,000 BABY = 0.05 BTC-equivalent weight
- 0.5 BTC + 5,000 BABY = 0.25 BTC-equivalent weight
- 0.01 BTC + 200 BABY = 0.01 BTC-equivalent weight

The formula works for any amounts - there's no minimum threshold!

❌ **Myth:** "If I delegate BABY to multiple validators, my co-staking rewards are calculated separately for each validator"<br/>
✅ **Reality:** All your BABY delegations are **summed together** for co-staking reward calculation, regardless of how many validators you delegate to.

**How it works:**
- The system calculates your total BABY staked across **all validators**
- All BABY delegations from the same address are combined
- The co-staking weight formula uses your **total BABY amount**, not per-validator amounts

**Example:**
- Alice has 1 BTC staked to a Finality Provider
- Alice delegates BABY to 3 different validators:
- 5,000 BABY to Validator A
- 8,000 BABY to Validator B
- 7,000 BABY to Validator C
- **Total BABY staked:** 5,000 + 8,000 + 7,000 = 20,000 BABY
- **Co-staking weight:** min(20,000 / 20,000, 1) = 1.0 BTC-equivalent ✅

**Key Points:**
- ✅ You can delegate to multiple validators - all BABY counts toward co-staking
- ✅ The system sums all your BABY delegations automatically
- ✅ As long as all delegations use the same BABY address as your BTC staking, they all count
- ✅ Diversifying across validators doesn't reduce your co-staking rewards

### Tips for Maximizing Rewards

1. **Balance Your Stakes**: Aim for a ratio close to 20,000 BABY per BTC
2. **Monitor Network Participation**: More co-stakers means rewards are shared more
3. **Keep Both Active**: Ensure both BTC and BABY delegations remain active
4. **Use Same Address**: Critical for eligibility
