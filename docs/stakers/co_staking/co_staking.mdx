# BTC-BABY Co-Staking Guide

## What is Co-Staking?

Co-staking allows you to earn **extra rewards** by staking both Bitcoin (BTC) and BABY tokens simultaneously. The more BABY you stake alongside your BTC, the more co-staking rewards you'll receive.

**Key Benefits:**
- Earn additional 2.35% annual inflation rewards on top of regular BTC and BABY staking rewards
- Maximize your returns by participating in both validation and finality provision
- Support the Babylon network's security while earning more

---

## Step-by-Step Guide to Co-Staking

### Step 1: Stake Bitcoin (BTC)

First, you need to have active BTC delegations to Finality Providers (FPs).

1. **Choose a Finality Provider**
- Select an active FP from the available list
- Consider factors like commission rate, uptime, and reputation

2. **Create a BTC Delegation**
- Use the staking interface to create your delegation
- Specify the amount of BTC you want to stake
- Complete the EOI (Expression of Interest) process
- Broadcast your BTC staking transaction

3. **Wait for Activation**
- Your delegation will move from `PENDING` → `VERIFIED` → `ACTIVE`
- Once `ACTIVE`, your BTC is providing security to the network

**Note:** Make sure to use the same BABY address for both BTC staking and BABY staking to be eligible for co-staking rewards.

### Step 2: Stake BABY Tokens

Next, stake BABY tokens to CometBFT validators using the same BABY address.

1. **Choose a Validator**
- Select a CometBFT validator from the validator list
- Consider commission rate and performance

2. **Delegate BABY Tokens**
- Navigate to the staking interface
- Enter the amount of BABY you want to stake
- Select your chosen validator
- Confirm the delegation transaction

3. **Verify Your Delegation**
- Check that your BABY delegation is active
- Ensure it's using the same address as your BTC staking

---

### Step 3: Understand Co-Staking Rewards

Co-staking rewards are calculated based on a **weighted formula** that considers both your BTC and BABY stakes.

#### The Formula

For each co-staker, the weight is calculated as:

```
w = min(B_BABY / R, B_BTC)
```

Where:
- `B_BABY` = Amount of BABY you have staked
- `B_BTC` = Amount of BTC you have staked to active FPs
- `R` = Co-staking factor = 20,000

This means: **Every 20,000 BABY staked makes 1 BTC eligible for co-staking rewards.**

**Important:** The weight can be any decimal value - you don't need at least 1 BTC or 20,000 BABY to earn rewards! Even small amounts will earn proportional rewards.

#### Reward Distribution

Your co-staking reward is calculated as:

```
Your Reward = Total Co-Staking Pool × (Your Weight / Total Weight of All Co-Stakers)
```

The total co-staking pool is **2.35% of annual inflation**.

### Step 4: Examples

#### Example 1: Small Stakes (0.1 BTC + 1,000 BABY)

**Setup:**
- Staked: 0.1 BTC
- Staked: 1,000 BABY

**Weight Calculation:**
```
w = min(1,000 / 20,000, 0.1)
w = min(0.05, 0.1)
w = 0.05
```

**Result:** You have **0.05 BTC-equivalent** weight and will earn co-staking rewards proportionally! Even small amounts count.

**Note:** To maximize this 0.1 BTC, you would need 2,000 BABY (0.1 × 20,000). Currently you have 1,000 BABY, so only 0.05 BTC-equivalent is eligible.

#### Example 2: Alice's Co-Staking

**Alice's Setup:**
- Staked: 6 BTC (across 3 delegations: 1 BTC, 2 BTC, 3 BTC)
- Staked: 50,000 BABY

**Weight Calculation:**
```
w = min(50,000 / 20,000, 6)
w = min(2.5, 6)
w = 2.5
```

**Result:** Alice's 2.5 BTC-equivalent is eligible for co-staking rewards.

---

#### Example 3: Bob's Co-Staking

**Bob's Setup:**
- Staked: 6 BTC (across 3 delegations: 1 BTC, 2 BTC, 3 BTC)
- Staked: 150,000 BABY

**Weight Calculation:**
```
w = min(150,000 / 20,000, 6)
w = min(7.5, 6)
w = 6
```

**Result:** All 6 of Bob's BTC are eligible for co-staking rewards.

---

#### Example 4: Reward Distribution

If Alice and Bob are the only co-stakers and the total co-staking reward is 10,000 BABY:

**Total Weight:**
```
W = 2.5 + 6 = 8.5
```

**Alice's Reward:**
```
Reward = 10,000 × (2.5 / 8.5) = 2,941 BABY
```

**Bob's Reward:**
```
Reward = 10,000 × (6 / 8.5) = 7,059 BABY
```

---

### Step 5: Monitor Your Rewards

1. **Check Your Co-Staking Status**
- Verify that both your BTC and BABY stakes are active
- Ensure they use the same BABY address

2. **Calculate Your Expected Rewards**
- Use the calculator below to estimate your co-staking rewards
- Remember: rewards depend on total network participation

3. **Withdraw Rewards**
- Co-staking rewards are automatically included when you withdraw BTC staking rewards
- Use `MsgWithdrawReward` with type `btc_staker` to claim all rewards

## Important Notes

### Requirements

✅ **Must have active BTC delegations** to Finality Providers
✅ **Must have active BABY delegations** to CometBFT validators
✅ **Must use the same BABY address** for both BTC and BABY staking
✅ **BTC delegations must be ACTIVE** (not just VERIFIED)

### Limitations

⚠️ **Commission cannot be charged** on co-staking rewards due to Cosmos SDK limitations
⚠️ **Rewards are proportional** - more co-stakers means smaller individual rewards
⚠️ **Optimal ratio** - You need 20,000 BABY per BTC to maximize rewards (but smaller amounts still earn proportionally)

### Common Misconceptions

❌ **Myth:** "I need at least 1 BTC or 20,000 BABY to earn co-staking rewards"
✅ **Reality:** Any amount of BTC and BABY will earn rewards proportionally. For example:
- 0.1 BTC + 1,000 BABY = 0.05 BTC-equivalent weight
- 0.5 BTC + 5,000 BABY = 0.25 BTC-equivalent weight
- 0.01 BTC + 200 BABY = 0.01 BTC-equivalent weight

The formula works for any amounts - there's no minimum threshold!

### Tips for Maximizing Rewards

1. **Balance Your Stakes**: Aim for a ratio close to 20,000 BABY per BTC
2. **Monitor Network Participation**: More co-stakers means rewards are shared more
3. **Keep Both Active**: Ensure both BTC and BABY delegations remain active
4. **Use Same Address**: Critical for eligibility
