Forks is a list of non-canonical `IndexedHeader`s at the same height.
For example, assuming the following blockchain
```
A <- B <- C <- D <- E
           \ -- D1
           \ -- D2
```
Then the fork will be \{[D1, D2]\} where each item is in struct `IndexedBlock`.

Note that each `IndexedHeader` in the fork should have a valid quorum
certificate. Such forks exist since Babylon considers CZs might have
dishonest majority. Also note that the IBC-Go implementation will only
consider the first header in a fork valid, since the subsequent headers
cannot be verified without knowing the validator set in the previous header.
