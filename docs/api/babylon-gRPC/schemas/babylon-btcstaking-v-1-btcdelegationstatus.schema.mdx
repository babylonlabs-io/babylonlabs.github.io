BTCDelegationStatus is the status of a delegation.
There are two possible valid state transition paths for a BTC delegation:
- PENDING -&gt; VERIFIED -&gt; ACTIVE -&gt; UNBONDED -&gt; EXPIRED
- PENDING -&gt; VERIFIED -&gt; ACTIVE -&gt; UNBONDED/EXPIRED
and one invalid state transition path:
- PENDING -&gt; VERIFIED -&gt; UNBONDED i.e the staker unbonded before
activating delegation on Babylon Genesis chain.
In valid transition paths, the delegation becomes UNBONDED when:
- either the staking transaction timelock expires
- or the staker requests early undelegation through MsgBTCUndelegate message.

 - PENDING: PENDING defines a delegation that is waiting for covenant signatures.
 - VERIFIED: VERIFIED defines a delegation that has covenant signatures but is not yet
included in the BTC chain.
 - ACTIVE: ACTIVE defines a delegation that has voting power
 - UNBONDED: UNBONDED defines a delegation no longer has voting power
by receiving unbonding tx with signatures from staker and covenant
committee
 - EXPIRED: EXPIRED defines a delegation no longer has voting power
for reaching the end of staking transaction timelock
 - ANY: ANY is any of the above status
