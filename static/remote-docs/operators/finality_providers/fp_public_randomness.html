<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The finality provider periodically commits public randomness to the consumer
chain to be used for future block finalization. This document specifies the
process of committing public randomness.</p>
<h2>Commit Process</h2>
<h3>Generating a Commit</h3>
<p>A randomness pair is essentially a pair of <code>32-byte</code> points over <code>secp256k1</code>.
A public randomness commit is a list of public
randomness, each committed to a specific height. In particular, a commit
consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a merkle root containing a list of public randomness values,</li>
<li>a start height, indicating from which height the randomness starts, and</li>
<li>the number of randomness contained in the merkle tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate a new commit, following steps are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a list of randomness. This requires an RPC call to the EOTS manager
(eotsd) to generate a list of public randomness, each corresponding to a
specific height according to the start height and the number of randomness in
the request. Randomness generation is required to be deterministic.</li>
<li>Construct the merkle tree based on the list of randomness using the CometBFT's <a href="https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/crypto/merkle">merkle</a>
library. The merkle root will be used in the commit, while each randomness
number and their merkle proofs will be used for finality vote submission
in the future.</li>
<li>Send a <a href="https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/blob/684d64ad74fed203fb846c032f2b55b3e3c36734/btcec/schnorr/signature.go#L391">Schnorr</a>
signature request to the EOTS manager over the hash of the commit
(concatenated by the start height, number of randomness, and the merkle root).</li>
<li>Build the commit message (<a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/aa99e2eb093e06cb9a28a58f373e8fa5f2494383/proto/babylon/finality/v1/tx.proto#L29">MsgCommitPubRandList</a>)
and send a transaction to Babylon.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Timing to Commit</h3>
<p>Public randomness is an essential component of finality. It should be
committed before finality votes can be sent. Otherwise, the finality provider
looses voting power for this height.</p>
<p>To this end, when a finality provider is started, it runs a loop to periodically
check whether it needs to make a new commit and calculate the start height of
the next commit. In particular:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">	tipHeightWithDelay := tipHeight + uint64(fp.cfg.TimestampingDelayBlocks)
	var startHeight uint64
	switch {
	case lastCommittedHeight &#x3C; tipHeightWithDelay:
		// the start height should consider the timestamping delay
		// as it is only available to use after tip height + estimated timestamping delay
		startHeight = tipHeightWithDelay
	case lastCommittedHeight &#x3C; tipHeightWithDelay+uint64(fp.cfg.NumPubRand):
		startHeight = lastCommittedHeight + 1
	default:
        // randomness is sufficient, do not need to make a commit
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lastCommittedHeight</code> is the end height (<code>startHeight + numRand - 1</code>)
from the latest public randomness commit recorded on the consumer chain</li>
<li><code>tipHeight</code> is the current height of the consumer chain</li>
<li><code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code> is a configuration value, which measures when to make a
new commit</li>
<li><code>NumPubRand</code> is the number of randomness in a commit defined in the config.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining TimestampingDelayBlocks</h3>
<p>The value of <code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code> must account for BTC-timestamping
delays, which is needed to activate the randomness for a specific height
after the committed epoch is BTC-timestamped. Here's an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The consumer chain receives a commit with:
<ul>
<li>Start height: 100</li>
<li>Number of randomness values: 1000</li>
<li>Current epoch: 10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means randomness for heights [100, 1099] becomes available after epoch 10
is finalized</li>
</ul>
<p>The BTC-timestamping protocol requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 BTC blocks for epoch finalization</li>
<li>â‰ˆ 1000 minutes (17 hours) at 10-minute average block time</li>
<li>With consumer chain blocks every 10 seconds, this equals approximately 6,000
blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code> should be around 6,000</li>
<li>Recommended production value: > 10,000 to provide additional safety margin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining Start Height</h3>
<p>To determine the start height of a commit:</p>
<ol>
<li>For first-time commit:
<ul>
<li><code>startHeight = baseHeight + 1</code>,</li>
<li>where <code>baseHeight</code> is a future height which is estimated based on the
BTC-timestamping delays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For subsequent commit:
<ul>
<li><code>startHeight = lastCommittedHeight + 1</code>,</li>
<li>where <code>lastCommittedHeight</code> is obtained from the consumer chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>baseHeight</code> can be specified via configuration or CLI options.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After long downtime, treat as first-time commit by specifying <code>baseHeight</code>.</li>
<li>Consecutiveness across commits is not enforced by the system but
different commits must not overlap.</li>
<li><code>startHeight</code> should not be higher than <code>finalityActivationHeight</code>,
a parameter defined in Babylon. Therefore,
<code>startHeight = max(startHeight, finalityActivationHeight)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining the Number of Randomness</h3>
<p>The number of randomness contained in a commit is specified in the config
<code>NumPubRand</code>. A general strategy is that the value should be as large
as possible. This is because each commit to the consumer chain costs gas.</p>
<p>However, in real life, this stategy might not always gain due to the following
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A finality provider might not have voting power for every block. Randomness
for those heights is a waste.</li>
<li>Generating more randomness leads to a larger merkle proof size which will be
used for sending finality votes.</li>
<li>Generating randomness and saving the merkle proofs require time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, given that the end height of a commit equals to
<code>startHeight + NumPubRand - 1</code>, we should ensure that the condition
<code>lastCommittedHeight > tipHeight + uint64(TimestampingDelayBlocks)</code> can hold for
a long period of time to avoid frequent commit of randomness.
In real life, the value of <code>NumPubRand</code> should be much larger than
<code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code>, e.g., <code>NumPubRand = 2 * TimestampingDelayBlocks</code>.</p>
