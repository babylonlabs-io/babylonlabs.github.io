    <h1>Public Randomness Commit Specification</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The finality provider periodically commits public randomness to the consumer
chain to be used for future block finalization. This document specifies the
process for committing public randomness.</p>
<h2>Commit Process</h2>
<h3>Generating a Commit</h3>
<p>A randomness pair is essentially a pair of <code>32-byte</code> points over <code>secp256k1</code>.
A public randomness commit is a commitment to an association
between public randomnesses and heights for them to be used.
In particular, a commit consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a merkle root containing a list of public randomness values,</li>
<li>a start height, indicating from which height the randomness starts, and</li>
<li>the number of randomness contained in the merkle tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate a new commit, following steps are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a list of randomness. This requires an RPC call to the EOTS manager
daemon (<code>eotsd</code>) to generate a list of public randomness,
each corresponding to a specific height according to the start height and
the number of randomness in the request.
Randomness generation is required to be deterministic.</li>
<li>Construct the merkle tree based on the list of randomness using the CometBFT's
<a href="https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/crypto/merkle">merkle</a>
library. The merkle root will be used in the commit, while each randomness
number and their merkle proofs will be used for finality vote submission
in the future.</li>
<li>Send a
<a href="https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/blob/684d64ad74fed203fb846c032f2b55b3e3c36734/btcec/schnorr/signature.go#L391">Schnorr</a>
signature request to the EOTS manager over the hash of the commit
(concatenated by the start height, number of randomness, and the merkle root).</li>
<li>Build the commit message
(<a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/aa99e2eb093e06cb9a28a58f373e8fa5f2494383/proto/babylon/finality/v1/tx.proto#L29">MsgCommitPubRandList</a>)
and send a transaction to Babylon.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Timing to Commit</h3>
<p>Public randomness is an essential component of finality voting. It should be
committed before finality votes can be sent.
If the finality provider does not have public randomness committed for a
specific height, they can't vote for it and therefore lose the voting power
they would have otherwise had for it.</p>
<p>To this end, when a finality provider is started, it runs a loop to periodically
check whether it needs to make a new commit and calculate the height
its next public randomness commit should start with. In particular:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">    // Estimate the consumer chain block height
    // a new commitment of public randomness would be Bitcoin timestamped
    // and ready for use, if the commitment was made in the current
    // consumer chain block.
	tipHeightWithDelay := tipHeight + uint64(fp.cfg.TimestampingDelayBlocks)
	var startHeight uint64
	switch {
	case lastCommittedHeight &#x3C; tipHeightWithDelay:
        // If the last height the finality provider has committed
        // randomness, is less than the estimation, then
        // the finality provider should commit randomness from that height.
		startHeight = tipHeightWithDelay
	case lastCommittedHeight &#x3C; tipHeightWithDelay+uint64(fp.cfg.NumPubRand):
        // otherwise, the finality provider should commit randomness
        // from the last height it has committed to
		startHeight = lastCommittedHeight + 1
	default:
        // randomness is sufficient, do not need to make a commit
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lastCommittedHeight</code> is the end height (<code>startHeight + numRand - 1</code>)
of the latest public randomness commit recorded on the consumer chain</li>
<li><code>tipHeight</code> is the current height of the consumer chain</li>
<li><code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code> is a configuration value, which measures when to make a
new commit</li>
<li><code>NumPubRand</code> is the number of randomness in a commit defined in the config.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining <code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code></h3>
<p>The configuration value <code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code> defines an estimation
estimation of the number of consumer chain blocks that will be generated
until a public randomness commit is Bitcoin timestamped.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The consumer chain receives a commit with:
<ul>
<li>Start height: 100</li>
<li>Number of randomness values: 1000</li>
<li>Current epoch: 10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means randomness for heights [100, 1099] becomes available after epoch 10
is finalized</li>
</ul>
<p>The BTC-timestamping protocol requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>300 BTC blocks for epoch finalization</li>
<li>â‰ˆ 3000 minutes (50 hours) at 10-minute average block time</li>
<li>With consumer chain blocks every 10 seconds, this equals approximately 18,000
blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code> should be around 18,000</li>
<li>Recommended production value: > 20,000 to provide additional safety margin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining the Start Height for a Commit</h3>
<p>To determine the start height for a commit:</p>
<ol>
<li>If this is a first time commit or the finality provider has not committed
for a long time:
<ul>
<li><code>startHeight = currentConsumerChainHeight + TimestampingDelayBlocks + 1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For subsequent commits:
<ul>
<li><code>startHeight = lastCommittedHeight + 1</code>,</li>
<li>where <code>lastCommittedHeight</code> is obtained from the consumer chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>baseHeight</code> can be specified via configuration or CLI options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consecutiveness across commits is not enforced by the system but
different commits must not overlap.</li>
<li><code>startHeight</code> should not be higher than <code>finalityActivationHeight</code>,
a parameter defined in Babylon Genesis specifying when the finality
protocol is activated.
Therefore, <code>startHeight = max(startHeight, finalityActivationHeight)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Determining the Number of Randomness</h3>
<p>The number of randomness contained in a commit is specified in the <code>NumPubRand</code>
configuration. A general strategy is that the value should be as large
as possible. This is because each commit of the consumer chain costs gas.</p>
<p>However, in real life, this stategy might not always gain due to the following
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A finality provider might not have voting power for every block. Randomness
for those heights is a waste.</li>
<li>Generating more randomness leads to a larger merkle proof size which will be
used for sending finality votes.</li>
<li>Generating randomness and saving the merkle proofs require time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, given that the end height of a commit equals to
<code>startHeight + NumPubRand - 1</code>, we should ensure that the condition
<code>lastCommittedHeight > tipHeight + uint64(TimestampingDelayBlocks)</code> can hold for
a long period of time to avoid frequent commit of randomness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>:
In real life, the value of <code>NumPubRand</code> should be much larger than
<code>TimestampingDelayBlocks</code>, e.g., <code>NumPubRand = 2 * TimestampingDelayBlocks</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>:
The finality provider daemon enforces a minimum
of <code>16384</code> of <code>NumPubRand</code> and a maximum of <code>50000</code>.</p>
