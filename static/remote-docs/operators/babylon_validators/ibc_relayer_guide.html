    <h1>IBC relaying guide</h1>
<p>Babylon uses <a href="https://ibcprotocol.dev/">IBC</a>
(Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol) to enable cross-chain
communication with other IBC enabled chains. This guide focuses on the specific
configurations needed
when relaying with Babylon, particularly around its unique unbonding period
mechanism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Babylon supports IBC Transfer and IBC-Wasm. It does not support ICA,
ICQ, IBC Hooks, or IBC Middleware yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Important Note on Babylon's Unbonding Period</h2>
<p>Babylon has a unique unbonding mechanism that differs from standard Cosmos SDK
chains. The Babylon Genesis chain disables the standard <code>x/staking</code> module and
wraps it with the <a href="../x/epoching/README.md">x/epoching module</a> module,
introducing secure, fast unbonding
through Bitcoin timestamping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The standard <code>x/staking</code> module's unbonding time parameter
remains at the default 21 days, but <strong>this value should be ignored</strong> when
configuring the relayer's trusting period.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Epoched Staking Mechanism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All staking operations and voting power adjustments are processed at the
last block of each epoch</li>
<li>The AppHash of the last block of each epoch is checkpointed onto the
Bitcoin blockchain
(this AppHash is derived from the entire execution trace prior to that
block)</li>
<li>On Babylon mainnet, each epoch spans 360 blocks (defined
by <code>epoch_interval</code> parameter
of <a href="../x/epoching/README.md">x/epoching module</a>) with 10s block times,
resulting in 1 hour epoch duration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finalization Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After an epoch is timestamped on a Bitcoin block, it becomes finalized
once the block reaches a certain depth</li>
<li>This is defined by the <code>checkpoint_finalization_timeout</code> parameter
of <a href="../x/btccheckpoint/README.md">x/btccheckpoint module</a></li>
<li>Any unbonding requests from that checkpointed epoch are then matured</li>
<li>On Babylon mainnet, the block must be 300-deep, and given Bitcoin's
average block time of ~10 minutes, the average unbonding
time is about 50 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IBC Light Client Configuration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBC light clients for Babylon Genesis on other chains should have a lower
trusting period</li>
<li>This is about 2/3 of the unbonding period, following standard IBC security
practices</li>
<li>This configuration only affects light clients of Babylon Genesis on other
chains</li>
<li>The trusting period of other chains' light clients on Babylon Genesis
remains unaffected</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to these unique characteristics, special attention is required when
configuring the relayer's trusting period and client refresh rate.</p>
<h2>Network-Specific Parameters</h2>
<p>The values mentioned above are specific to Babylon mainnet. For other networks (
testnet, etc.), you can retrieve these values using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Query epoch interval
babylond query epoching params

# Query checkpoint finalization timeout
babylond query btccheckpoint params
</code></pre>
<p>For RPC and LCD endpoints for different networks, refer to
the <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/networks/tree/main/bbn-test-5">Babylon Networks Repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Relayer Configuration</h2>
<p>When setting up a relayer for Babylon, pay special attention to these
parameters. The following values are specific to Babylon mainnet:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Trusting Period</strong>: Should be set to approximately 2/3 of the network's
unbonding period</p>
<ul>
<li>On Babylon mainnet, the unbonding period is ~50 hours (based on ~300 BTC
blocks), therefore the trusting period should be set to ~33 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Client Refresh Rate</strong>: A higher refresh rate is recommended (1/5 of
trusting period)</p>
<ul>
<li>On Babylon mainnet, this is ~6.6 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example Hermes configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[mode.clients]
refresh = true

[[chains]]
trusting_period = "33 hours"
client_refresh_rate = "1/5"
</code></pre>
<p>For complete setup instructions, including wallet configuration, connection
setup, and channel creation, refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/ibc-relayer">Celestia's IBC Relayer Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.osmosis.zone/osmosis-core/relaying/relayer-guide">Osmosis's Relayer Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Monitoring and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Regular monitoring of your IBC clients is crucial. For example, if using Hermes,
you can monitor the <code>client_updates_submitted_total</code> metric, which counts the
number of client update messages submitted between chains. This metric should
increase over time as your relayer submits updates to keep the IBC clients
synchronized. For detailed information about this metric as well as other
important metrics, refer
to <a href="https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/telemetry/operators.html#what-is-the-overall-ibc-status-of-each-network">Hermes metrics documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Handling Expired/Frozen IBC Clients</h2>
<p>If an IBC client expires or becomes frozen, you'll need to submit a governance
proposal to recover the client. This proposal needs to be submitted on the chain
that maintains the light client of the counterparty chain.</p>
<p>For example, if you're relaying between Babylon and another chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the light client of the other chain (maintained on Babylon) expires, submit
the proposal on Babylon</li>
<li>If the light client of Babylon (maintained on the other chain) expires, submit
the proposal on the other chain</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed steps on how to submit an IBC client recovery proposal, refer to
the <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/proposals.html#steps">IBC Governance Proposals Guide</a>.
For more information about submitting governance proposals on Babylon, including
parameters and requirements, see
the <a href="https://docs.babylonlabs.io/guides/governance/">Babylon Governance Guide</a>.</p>
