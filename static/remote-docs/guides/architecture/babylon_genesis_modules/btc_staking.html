<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>Babylon's Bitcoin Staking protocol allows bitcoin holders to <em>trustlessly</em> stake
their bitcoin for providing economic security to the Babylon chain and other
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, <em>without bridging their bitcoin elsewhere</em>.</p>
<h3>Actors</h3>
<p>The following actors interact with the BTC staking module:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC stakers (aka delegators)</strong> delegate their bitcoin to a finality
provider in order to obtain provide economic security to the PoS system.
They interact with the <code>x/btcstaking</code> module to express their
interest to stake, notify about their staking receiving relevant confirmations,
or performing both of the previous steps (staking + staking confirmation notification)
at once.</li>
<li><strong>Finality providers</strong> receive bitcoin delegations and participate in the
<em>finality vote round</em> on top of the CometBFT consensus.
They interact with the <code>x/btcstaking</code> module in order
to register or update their finality provider keys and information. For the
remainder of their operations (voting, submitting public randomness),
finality providers interact with the <a href="../x/finality"><code>x/finality</code></a> module.</li>
<li><strong>Covenant emulators</strong> who serve as
<a href="https://covenants.info">covenants</a> to enforce spending conditions on bitcoin
staked on Babylon.
<a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/covenant-emulator">Covenant emulators</a>
interact with the <code>x/btcstaking</code> module to submit covenant signatures for the
slashing, unbonding, and unbonding slashing transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Vigilantes</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/vigilante">Vigilante BTC Staking Trackers</a>
monitor the Bitcoin staking ledger to identify whether staking transactions have been unbonded
or whether a staking transaction the staker intended to create has been included and confirmed
in the Bitcoin ledger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stake Creation</h3>
<h4>Post-staking Registration</h4>
<p>A Bitcoin staker can receive voting power through their Bitcoin stake delegation
by following this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Bitcoin staking transaction and submit it to Bitcoin. The
staking transaction locks the staker's bitcoin for a pre-determined
timelock and specifies slashing conditions.</li>
<li>The BTC staker constructs the following transactions (whose specifications
can be found <a href="../../docs/staking-script.md">here</a>):
<ul>
<li>a pre-signed <em>slashing transaction</em> that can spend the staking transaction once the
finality provider is slashed,</li>
<li>an unsigned <em>unbonding transaction</em> that spends the staking transaction to start
the early unbonding process, and</li>
<li>a pre-signed <em>unbonding slashing transaction</em> that can spend the unbonding
transaction once the finality provider is slashed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the staking transaction is confirmed on Bitcoin, the BTC staker sends
the staking transaction, its inclusion proof, slashing transaction,
unbonding transaction, and unbonding slashing transaction to Babylon.
This happens by the submission of a <a href="#msgcreatebtcdelegation">MsgCreateBTCDelegation</a> message.</li>
<li>The covenant emulators verify the transactions and submit their pre-signatures
for the slashing transactions and unbonding transaction.
The BTC Delegation is now activated.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Pre-staking Registration</h4>
<p>The above mechanism requires the staker to first lock their funds
and then request the Babylon blockchain to activate the stake.
For stakers that want to avoid this and prefer to first receive confirmation
and then lock their funds on Bitcoin, the pre-staking registration
can be used.</p>
<p>The pre-staking registration procedure works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The BTC staker constructs the following transactions (whose specifications
can be found <a href="../../docs/staking-script.md">here</a>) and sends them on Babylon
through the <a href="#msgcreatebtcdelegation">MsgCreateBTCDelegation</a> message with the
inclusion proof not set:
<ul>
<li>an unsigned <em>staking transaction</em> committing their funds.</li>
<li>a pre-signed <em>slashing transaction</em> that can spend the staking transaction once the
finality provider is slashed,</li>
<li>an unsigned <em>unbonding transaction</em> that spends the staking transaction to start
the early unbonding process, and</li>
<li>a pre-signed <em>unbonding slashing transaction</em> that can spend the unbonding
transaction once the finality provider is slashed. The BTC staker
pre-signs the slashing transaction and unbonding slashing transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The covenant committee verifies the above transactions and add the
required signatures for the slashing transactions.</li>
<li>The BTC staker views the above confirmation and can now feel confident in submitting
the transaction to Bitcoin.</li>
<li>Once the transaction is on Bitcoin and with sufficient confirmations
the staker can send a
<a href="#msgaddbtcdelegationinclusionproof">MsgAddBTCDelegationInclusionProof</a>
with the inclusion proof for the stake receiving sufficient confirmations.
The stake is now active. In the case the staker does not monitor the Bitcoin
ledger for confirmation, the <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/vigilante">Vigilante BTC Staking Tracker</a>
will pick it up and submit the inclusion proof to Babylon.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Voting Power and Finality</h3>
<p>Babylon's <a href="../finality">Finality module</a> will make use of the voting power table
maintained in the BTC Staking module to determine the finalization status of
each block, identify equivocations of finality providers, and slash BTC
delegations under culpable finality providers.</p>
<h3>On-Demand Unbonding Tracking</h3>
<p>A BTC staker can unbond early by signing the unbonding transaction and
submitting it to Bitcoin. The BTC Staking module identifies unbonding requests
through this signature reported by the <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/vigilante">BTC staking tracker
daemon</a>, and will consider the BTC
delegation unbonded immediately upon such a signature.</p>
<h2>States</h2>
<p>The BTC Staking module uses the following prefixed namespaces within its KV store to organize different types of data</p>

<h3>MsgBTCUndelegate</h3>
<p>The <code>MsgBTCUndelegate</code> message is used for unbonding bitcoin from a given
finality provider. It is typically reported by the <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/vigilante/tree/main/btcstaking-tracker">BTC staking
tracker</a>
program which proactively monitors unbonding transactions on Bitcoin.</p>

</code></pre>
<h3>MsgSelectiveSlashingEvidence</h3>
<p>The <code>MsgSelectiveSlashingEvidence</code> message is used for submitting evidences for
selective slashing offences. In a selective slashing offence, the adversarial
finality provider chooses a victim BTC delegation, signs its slashing
transaction, and decrypts covenant adaptor signatures to the Schnorr signatures
using its secret key, before submitting this slashing transaction to Bitcoin. By
observing a pair of a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki">Schnorr
signature</a> and
an <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/adaptor-signatures/">adaptor signature</a>
from the covenant committee, anyone can extract the finality provider's secret
key due to the <a href="../../crypto/schnorr-adaptor-signature/README.md">adaptor signature
properties</a>.</p>

}
</code></pre>
<p>Upon <code>MsgSelectiveSlashingEvidence</code>, a Babylon node will execute as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the BTC delegation with the given staking transaction hash.</li>
<li>Ensure the BTC delegation is active or unbonding.</li>
<li>Ensure the given secret key corresponds to the finality provider's public
key.</li>
<li>At this point, the finality provider must have done selective slashing. Thus,
slash the finality provider and emit an event <code>EventSelectiveSlashing</code> about
this.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>MsgSelectiveSlashingEvidence</code> is typically reported by the <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/vigilante/tree/main/btcstaking-tracker">BTC staking
tracker</a>
program. It keeps monitoring for slashing transactions on Bitcoin. Upon each
slashing transaction, it will try to extract the finality provider's secret key.
If successful, it will construct a <code>MsgSelectiveSlashingEvidence</code> message and
submit it to Babylon.</p>
<h2>BeginBlocker</h2>
<p>Upon <code>BeginBlock</code>, the BTC Staking module will index the current BTC tip height. This will be used for determining the status of BTC delegations.</p>
<p>The logic is defined at <a href="./abci.go">x/btcstaking/abci.go</a>.</p>
