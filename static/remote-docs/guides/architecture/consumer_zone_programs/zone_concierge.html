<html><body><article><h1>ZoneConcierge</h1>
<p>The Zone Concierge module is responsible for generating BTC timestamps of
headers from other PoS blockchains. These BTC timestamps allow PoS blockchains
integrating with Babylon to achieve Bitcoin security, i.e., forking the PoS
blockchain is as hard as forking Bitcoin. The Zone Concierge module leverages
the IBC protocol to receive PoS blockchains' headers and provide them with
succinct and provable information about their timestamps.</p>
<p>There are two phases of integration for a PoS blockchain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1 integration:</strong> Babylon receives PoS blockchain headers via standard
<code>MsgUpdateClient</code> messages in IBC light client protocol, timestamps them, and
functions as a canonical chain oracle for the PoS blockchain.
<a href="https://babylonscan.io/">Babylonscan</a> shows PoS blockchains with phase 1
integration.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2 integration:</strong> In addition to phase 1, phase 2 allows a PoS
blockchain to receive BTC timestamps from Babylon via an IBC channel, such
that the PoS blockchain can use BTC timestamps to detect and resolve forks, as
well as other use cases such as Bitcoin-assisted fast unbonding.</li>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>The Zone Concierge module is responsible for providing BTC timestamps of headers
from PoS blockchains connected to Babylon via the IBC protocol.<br>
These BTC timestamps allow PoS blockchains to achieve Bitcoin security, i.e.,
forking a PoS blockchain is as hard as forking Bitcoin. The Zone Concierge
module leverages the IBC light client protocol to receive headers with a valid
quorum certificate from PoS blockchains. These headers are then timestamped
together with the Babylon blockchain by Bitcoin, thereby achieving Bitcoin
security. The BTC timestamps can be propagated back to the PoS blockchains, such
that PoS blockchains can know their headers that have been checkpointed by
Bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Babylon aims to provide Bitcoin security to other PoS blockchains. This involves
two functionalities: 1) checkpointing Babylon to Bitcoin, and 2) checkpointing
other PoS blockchains to Babylon. The {<a href="../epoching/">Epoching</a>,
<a href="../checkpointing/">Checkpointing</a>, <a href="../btccheckpoint/">BTCCheckpoint</a>,
<a href="../btclightclient/">BTCLightclient</a>} modules jointly provide the functionality
of checkpointing Babylon to Bitcoin. The <a href="./">Zone Concierge module</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go">IBC modules</a> jointly provide the
functionality of checkpointing PoS blockchains to Babylon.</p>
<p>In order to checkpoint PoS blockchains to Babylon, Babylon needs to receive
headers of PoS blockchains and maintain all headers that have a <em>quorum
certificate</em> (a set of signatures from validators with > 2/3 total voting
power). Checkpointing canonical headers allows Babylon to act as a canonical
chain oracle. Checkpointing fork headers allows Babylon to identify dishonest
majority attacks.</p>
<p>To summarize, the Zone Concierge module aims at providing the following
guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timestamping headers:</strong> Babylon checkpoints PoS blockchains' (canonical and
fork) headers with a valid quorum certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Verifiability of timestamps:</strong> Babylon can provide a proof that a given
header is checkpointed by Bitcoin, where the proof is publicly verifiable
assuming access to a BTC light client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>BTC is always secure with the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation">k-deep confirmation
rule</a>;</li>
<li>There exists >=1 honest IBC relayer and vigilante {submitter, reporter}; and</li>
<li>The network is synchronous (i.e., messages are delivered within a known and
finite time bound).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the Bitcoin timestamping protocol uses Bitcoin as a single source of
truth, and does not make any assumption on the fraction of adversarial
validators in Babylon or PoS blockchains. That is, the above statement shall
hold even if Babylon and a PoS blockchain have dishonest supermajority. The
formal security analysis of the Bitcoin timestamping protocol can be found at
the Bitcoin timestamping <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08392.pdf">reseaarch paper</a>
published at <a href="https://sp2023.ieee-security.org/">S&#x26;P'23</a>.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Zone Concierge module is responsible for checkpointing headers from PoS
blockchains and propagating succinct and verifiable information about them back
to the PoS blockchains. Specifically, the Zone Concierge module</p>
<ul>
<li>leverages IBC light clients for checkpointing PoS blockchains;</li>
<li>intercepts and indexes headers from PoS blockchains; and</li>
<li>provides BTC timestamps proving that a header is checkpointed by Babylon and
Bitcoin (via queries or IBC packets).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leveraging IBC light clients for checkpointing PoS blockchains.</strong> Babylon
leverages the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/client/ics-007-tendermint-client">IBC light client
protocol</a>
to receive and verify headers of PoS blockchains. The IBC light client protocol
allows a blockchain <code>A</code> to maintain a <em>light client</em> of another blockchain <code>B</code>.
The light client contains a subset of headers in the ledger of blockchain <code>B</code>,
securing the following properties when blockchain <code>B</code> has more than 2/3 honest
voting power and there exists at least 1 honest IBC relayer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> The IBC light client in blockchain <code>A</code> is consistent with the
ledger of blockchain <code>B</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Liveness:</strong> The IBC light client in blockchain <code>A</code> keeps growing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Verifying a header is done by a special <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07031">quorum intersection
mechanism</a>: upon a header from the relayer,
the light client checks whether the intersected voting power between the quorum
certificates of the current tip and the header is more than 1/3 of the voting
power in the current tip. If yes, then this ensures that there exists at least
one honest validator in the header's quorum certificate, and this header is
agreed by all honest validators.</p>
<p>Babylon leverages the IBC light client protocol to checkpoint PoS blockchains to
itself. In particular, each header with a valid quorum certificate can be viewed
as a timestamp, and Babylon can generate an inclusion proof that a given header
of a PoS blockchain is committed to Babylon's <code>AppHash</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Intercepting and Indexing Headers from PoS blockchains.</strong> In order to further
checkpoint headers of PoS blockchains to Bitcoin, the Zone Concierge module
builds an index recording headers' positions on Babylon's ledger, which will
eventually be checkpointed by Bitcoin. To this end, the Zone Concierge module
intercepts headers from IBC light clients via a
<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#runtx-antehandler-runmsgs-posthandler">PostHandler</a>,
and indexes them.</p>
<p>Note that the Zone Concierge module intercepts all headers that have a valid
quorum certificate, including canonical headers and fork headers. A fork header
with a valid quorum certificate is a signal of the dishonest majority attack:
the majority of validators are dishonest and sign conflicted headers.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Proofs that a Header is Checkpointed by Bitcoin.</strong> To support use
cases that need to verify BTC timestamps of headers, Zone Concierge can provide
proofs that the headers are indeed checkpointed to Bitcoin. The proof includes
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ProofCzHeaderInEpoch</code>: Proof that the header of the PoS blockchain is
included in an epoch of Babylon;</li>
<li><code>ProofEpochSealed</code>: Proof that the epoch has been agreed by > 2/3 voting power
of the validator set; and</li>
<li><code>ProofEpochSubmitted</code>: Proof that the epoch's checkpoint has been submitted to
Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first proof is formed as a Merkle proof that the IBC header is committed to
the <code>AppHash</code> after the epoch. The second proof is formed as a BLS
multi-signature jointly generated by the epoch's validator set. The last proof
is formed as Merkle proofs of two transactions that constitute a BTC checkpoint,
same as in <a href="../btccheckpoint/README.md">BTCCheckpoint module</a>.</p>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<p>The Bitcoin-checkpointed PoS blockchain will enable several applications, such
as raising alarms upon dishonest majority attacks and reducing the unbonding
period. These use cases require new plugins in the PoS blockchains, and will be
developed by Babylon team in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Raising Alarms upon Dishonest Majority Attacks.</strong> Zone Concierge timestamps
fork headers that have valid quorum certificates. Such fork header signals a
safety attack launched by the dishonest majority of validators. Babylon can send
the fork header back to the corresponding PoS blockchain, such that the PoS
blockchain will get notified with this dishonest majority attack, and can decide
to stall or initiate a social consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Unbonding Period.</strong> Zone Concierge provides a Bitcoin-checkpointed
prefix for a PoS blockchain. Such Bitcoin-checkpointed prefix resists against
the long range attacks, thus unbonding requests in this prefix can be safely
finished, leading to much shorter unbonding period compared to that in existing
PoS blockchains (e.g., 21 days in Cosmos SDK chains).</p>
<h2>State</h2>
<p>The Zone Concierge module keeps handling IBC headers of PoS blockchains, and
maintains the following KV stores.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>The <a href="./keeper/params.go">parameter storage</a> maintains Zone Concierge module's

</code></pre>
<h2>PostHandler for intercepting IBC headers</h2>
<p>The Zone Concierge module implements a
<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/advanced/baseapp#runtx-antehandler-runmsgs-posthandler">PostHandler</a>
<code>IBCHeaderDecorator</code> to intercept headers sent to the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/v8.0.0/modules/core/02-client">IBC client
module</a>.
The <code>IBCHeaderDecorator</code> PostHandler is defined at
<a href="./keeper/header_handler.go">x/zoneconcierge/keeper/header_handler.go</a>, and
works as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the PoS blockchain hosting the header is not known to Babylon, initialize
<code>ChainInfo</code> storage for the PoS blockchain.</li>
<li>If the header is on a fork, insert the header to the fork storage and update
<code>ChainInfo</code>.</li>
<li>If the header is canonical, insert the header to the canonical chain storage
and update <code>ChainInfo</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>The Zone Concierge module subscribes to the Epoching module's <code>AfterEpochEnds</code>
<a href="../epoching/types/hooks.go">hook</a> for indexing the epochs when receiving
headers from PoS blockchains, and the Checkpointing module's
<code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code> <a href="../checkpointing/types/hooks.go">hook</a> for phase
2 integration.</p>
<h3>Indexing headers upon <code>AfterEpochEnds</code></h3>
<p>The <code>AfterEpochEnds</code> hook is triggered upon an epoch is ended, i.e., the last
block in this epoch has been committed by CometBFT. Upon <code>AfterEpochEnds</code>, the
Zone Concierge will save the current <code>ChainInfo</code> to the <code>EpochChainInfo</code> storage
for each PoS blockchain.</p>
<h3>Sending BTC timestamps upon <code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code></h3>
<p>The <code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code> hook is triggered upon a checkpoint becoming
<em>finalized</em>, i.e., Bitcoin transactions of the checkpoint become <code>w</code>-deep in
Bitcoin's canonical chain, where <code>w</code> is the <code>checkpoint_finalization_timeout</code>
<a href="../../proto/babylon/btccheckpoint/v1/params.proto">parameter</a> in the
<a href="../btccheckpoint/">BTCCheckpoint</a> module.</p>
<p>Upon <code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code>, the Zone Concierge module will prepare and
send a BTC timestamp to each PoS blockchain.<br>
The <a href="../../proto/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/packet.proto">BTCTimestamp</a> structure<br>
includes a header and a set of proofs that the header is checkpointed by
Bitcoin.</p>
<pre><code class="language-protobuf">// BTCTimestamp is a BTC timestamp that carries information of a BTC-finalized epoch
// It includes a number of BTC headers, a raw checkpoint, an epoch metadata, and

</code></pre>
<p>Upon <code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code> is triggered, the Zone Concierge module will
send an IBC packet including a <code>BTCTimestamp</code> to each PoS blockchain doing
<a href="#interaction-with-pos-blockchains-under-phase-2-integration">phase 2
integration</a> with
Babylon. The logic is defined at
<a href="./keeper/hooks.go">x/zoneconcierge/keeper/hooks.go</a> and works as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all open IBC channels with Babylon's Zone Concierge module. The
counterparty at each IBC channel is a PoS blockchain.</li>
<li>Get all BTC headers to be sent in BTC timestamps. Specifically,
<ol>
<li>Find the segment of BTC headers sent upon the last time
<code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code> is triggered.</li>
<li>If all BTC headers in the segment are no longer canonical, the BTC headers
to be sent will be the last <code>w+1</code> ones in the BTC light client, where <code>w</code>
is the <code>checkpoint_finalization_timeout</code>
<a href="../../proto/babylon/btccheckpoint/v1/params.proto">parameter</a> in the
<a href="../btccheckpoint/">BTCCheckpoint</a> module.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the BTC headers to be sent will be from the latest header that
is still canonical in the segment to the current tip of the BTC light
client.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For each of these IBC channels:
<ol>
<li>Find the <code>ConsumerID</code> of the counterparty chain (i.e., the PoS blockchain) in
the IBC channel.</li>
<li>Get the <code>ChainInfo</code> of the <code>ConsumerID</code> at the last finalized epoch.</li>
<li>Get the metadata of the last finalized epoch and its corresponding raw
checkpoint.</li>
<li>Generate the proof that the last PoS blockchain's canonical header is
committed to the epoch's metadata.</li>
<li>Generate the proof that the epoch is sealed, i.e., receives a BLS
multisignature generated by validators with >2/3 total voting power at the
last finalized epoch.</li>
<li>Generate the proof that the epoch's checkpoint is submitted, i.e., encoded
in transactions on Bitcoin.</li>
<li>Assemble all the above and the BTC headers obtained in step 2 as
<code>BTCTimestamp</code>, and send it to the IBC channel in an IBC packet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Interaction with PoS blockchains under phase 1 integration</h2>
<p>In phase 1 integration, Babylon maintains headers for a PoS blockchain via the
IBC light client protocol. The IBC light client of the PoS blockchain is
checkpointed by Bitcoin via Babylon, thus achieves Bitcoin security.</p>
<p>Babylon utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/client/ics-007-tendermint-client">IBC light client
protocol</a>
for receiving headers from other PoS blockchains. The IBC headers are
encapsulated in the IBC protocol's <code>MsgUpdateClient</code>
<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/proto/ibc/core/client/v1/tx.proto#L20-L21">messages</a>,
and are sent to the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/v8.0.0/modules/core/02-client">IBC client
module</a> by
an <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/relayer/ics-018-relayer-algorithms/README.md">IBC
relayer</a>.
The <code>IBCHeaderDecorator</code> PostHandler intercepts the headers and indexes their
positions in the <code>ChainInfo</code> storage, as per
<a href="#indexing-headers-upon-afterepochends">here</a>. This effectively checkpoints the
headers of PoS blockchains, completing the phase 1 integration.</p>
<h2>Interaction with PoS blockchains under phase 2 integration</h2>
<p>In phase 2 integration, Babylon does everything in phase 1, and will send BTC
timestamps of headers back to each PoS blockchain. Each PoS blockchain can
verify the BTC timestamp and ensure that each header is finalized by Bitcoin,
thus obtaining Bitcoin security. The BTC timestamps can be used by the PoS
blockchain<br>
for different use cases, e.g., BTC-assisted unbonding.</p>
<p>The phase 2 integration does not require any change to the PoS blockchain's
code. Rather, it only needs to deploy a <a href="https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon-contract">Babylon
contract</a> on the PoS
blockchain, and start an IBC relayer between Babylon and the Babylon contract on
the PoS blockchain. The Babylon contract can be deployed to a blockchain
supporting <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm">CosmWasm</a> smart contracts,
connects with Babylon's Zone Concierge module via an IBC channel, and receives
BTC timestamps from Babylon to help the PoS blockchain get Bitcoin security.</p>
<p>Upon a Babylon epoch becoming finalized, i.e., upon
<code>AfterRawCheckpointFinalized</code> is triggered, Babylon will send an IBC packet
including a <code>BTCTimestamp</code> to each PoS blockchain doing phase 2/3 integration
with Babylon, as per
<a href="#sending-btc-timestamps-upon-afterrawcheckpointfinalized">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Zone Concierge provides 1-to-all connection, where the Zone Concierge
module establishes an IBC channel with each of multiple consumer chains. Zone
Concierge will send an BTC timestamp to each of these consumer chains upon an
epoch is finalized.</p>
<h2>Messages and Queries</h2>
<p>The Zone Concierge module only has one message <code>MsgUpdateParams</code> for updating
the module parameters via a governance proposal.</p>
<p>It provides a set of queries about the status of checkpointed PoS blockchains,
listed at
<a href="https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/developer-guides/grpcrestapi#tag/ZoneConcierge">docs.babylonlabs.io</a>.</p>
