# Documentation Restructuring Plan: Promote TBV

**Branch:** `jenks/restructure-promote-tbv`
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Stakeholders:** Vitalis (Head of Eng), Xinshu (Product Head), Jenks (Project Lead)

---

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the engineering and product requests to:
1. **Remove BSN-related docs** (not launching BSNs soon)
2. **Move chain-specific docs under Babylon Genesis** (demote from top-level)
3. **Promote Bitcoin Trusted Vault (BTV)** as primary product in overview
4. **Make BTC Staking top-level** instead of Babylon Genesis (per Xinshu)

---

## Current Navigation Structure

**Navbar (docusaurus.config.js lines 200-255):**
```
Overview → /guides/overview/
Stakers → /stakers/
Developers → /developers/
Operators → /operators/
API (dropdown)
Support → Discord
```

**Sidebars (sidebars-default.js):**
- `guides` → autogenerated from `docs/guides/`
- `stakers` → autogenerated from `docs/stakers/`
- `developers` → autogenerated from `docs/developers/`
- `operators` → autogenerated from `docs/operators/`
- `bsns` → autogenerated from `docs/bsns/` (doesn't exist!)

## Detailed Change Actions

### PHASE 1: Remove BSN Content

| URL | File Path | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| `/guides/overview/bsns/` | `docs/guides/overview/bsns/` | **DELETE** entire directory |
| `/guides/architecture/consumer_zone_programs/` | `docs/guides/architecture/consumer_zone_programs/` | **DELETE** entire directory |

**Files to delete:**
```
docs/guides/overview/bsns/
├── _category_.json
├── bsns.mdx
├── cosmos_chains/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   ├── babylon_sdk.mdx
│   ├── cosmos_chains.mdx
│   ├── integrating_as_cosmos_chain.mdx
│   ├── running_btc_staker.mdx
│   └── running_finality_provider.mdx
└── op_stack_chains/
    ├── _category_.json
    └── op_stack_chains.mdx

docs/guides/architecture/consumer_zone_programs/
├── _category_.json
├── babylon_contracts.mdx
├── consumer_zone_programs.mdx
├── ibc_relayer.mdx
└── zone_concierge.mdx
```

### PHASE 2: Create `babylon-genesis/` Section

**Create new directory structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/babylon-genesis/architecture
mkdir -p docs/babylon-genesis/modules
mkdir -p docs/babylon-genesis/networks
mkdir -p docs/babylon-genesis/governance
mkdir -p docs/babylon-genesis/specifications
```

**Move content:**

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| `docs/guides/architecture/architecture.mdx` | `docs/babylon-genesis/architecture/` |
| `docs/guides/architecture/btc_staking_program/` | `docs/babylon-genesis/architecture/btc_staking_program/` |
| `docs/guides/architecture/vigilantes/` | `docs/babylon-genesis/architecture/vigilantes/` |
| `docs/guides/architecture/babylon_genesis_modules/` | `docs/babylon-genesis/modules/` (or DELETE) |
| `docs/guides/networks/` | `docs/babylon-genesis/networks/` |
| `docs/guides/governance/` | `docs/babylon-genesis/governance/` |
| `docs/guides/specifications/` | `docs/babylon-genesis/specifications/` |

### PHASE 3: Create New `overview/` Section

**Create simplified overview:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/overview
```

**Move and reorganize:**

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| `docs/guides/overview/bitcoin-vault.mdx` | `docs/overview/bitcoin-vault.mdx` |
| `docs/guides/overview/bitcoin_staking.mdx` | `docs/overview/bitcoin-staking.mdx` |
| Create new | `docs/overview/index.mdx` (product-focused landing) |

### PHASE 4: Clean Up `guides/` Directory

After moves, `docs/guides/` should only contain:
```
docs/guides/
├── index.mdx          ← Update to redirect or remove
├── overview/
│   └── babylon_genesis/  ← Move to babylon-genesis/ or keep as link
├── research/          ← Keep or move to reference
├── security/          ← Keep visible
└── support/           ← Keep visible
```

  stakers: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'stakers' }],
  developers: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'developers' }],
  operators: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'operators' }],

  // NEW consolidated Genesis section

  items: [
    {
      label: 'Overview',
      to: '/overview/',              // Changed from /guides/overview/
      className: 'guides-top-header',
    },
    {
      label: 'Stakers',
      to: '/stakers/',
    },

      label: 'Developers',
      to: '/developers/',
    },
    {
      label: 'Operators',
      to: '/operators/',
    },
    {
      label: 'Babylon Genesis',       // NEW: Demoted to nav item
      to: '/babylon-genesis/',        // Contains all chain-specific docs
    },
    {
      label: 'API',
      items: [...],                   // Unchanged
    },

},
```

### Add Redirects:

```javascript
redirects: [
  // Existing
  { from: '/guides/baby_stakers/baby_staking_tools/', to: '/stakers/baby_stakers/' },

  // Overview redirects
  { from: '/guides/overview/', to: '/overview/' },
  { from: '/guides/overview/bitcoin_staking/', to: '/overview/bitcoin-staking/' },

],
```

## New Overview Landing Page Content

**`docs/overview/index.mdx`:**

```mdx

title: "Babylon Protocol"
sidebar_label: Overview
sidebar_position: 1

# Babylon Protocol

Babylon provides Bitcoin-native infrastructure for the decentralized economy.

## Products

### Trustless Bitcoin Vault (TBV)
Trustless Bitcoin Vault is a toolkit that securely connects Bitcoin on-chain state to
external smart contracts and systems. Using on-chain contracts, light-client
proofs (SNARKs), and independent indexers, it enables verifying Bitcoin
consensus and UTXO state without trusting any single third party.

[Learn more about Trustless Bitcoin Vault →](/overview/bitcoin-vault/)

### Bitcoin Staking
Babylon enables native bitcoin staking directly on the Bitcoin blockchain
without intermediaries. BTC holders can stake their assets while maintaining
full custody, participating in securing proof-of-stake networks.

[Learn more about Bitcoin Staking →](/overview/bitcoin-staking/)

## Technical Foundation

The Babylon Genesis chain serves as the coordination layer for the protocol,
built on Cosmos SDK with CosmWasm support.

## Questions for Stakeholders

1. **Babylon Genesis Modules**: Delete entirely (Vitalis preference) or keep under `/babylon-genesis/modules/`?

2. **Research docs**: Keep under `guides/research/` or move to `babylon-genesis/`?

3. **BSN Archive**: Should we git-archive the BSN content before deletion, or just delete?

4. **New Overview Image**: The current overview diagram is BSN-centric. Create new BTV/Staking focused diagram?

2. Create babylon-genesis structure
3. Move content to babylon-genesis
4. Create new overview
5. Update configurations
6. Test and verify
7. Review with stakeholders
8. Merge to dev
9. Final review on dev
